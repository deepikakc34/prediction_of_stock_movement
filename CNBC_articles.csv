Oil extends gains from record lows    U.S. crude futures  rose 2.7% to settle at $16.94 per barrel, amid hopes the U.S. will reduce some of its production to account for shrinking demand and storage capacity. Stocks also got a boost after Reuters reported that a U.S. government-led trial of remdesivir was running ahead of schedule. The report said those results could be ready by mid-May, with preliminary numbers possibly out earlier.   Boeing drops, Apple climbs      Boeing  shares dropped 6.36% on news the airplane maker was delaying the return of the 737 Max.

Bruce Bennett | Getty Images      The stock market is struggling to make headway, as a big week of events rolls around, including a Federal Reserve meeting, the first look at post-shutdown economic growth and earnings from more than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies.  it's a busy week for earnings, and some of the biggest blue chips are likely to join the growing list of companies withdrawing guidance amid the uncertainty of how the  coronavirus and shutdowns are impacting their business.  Apple ,  Microsoft,   Amazon ,  Facebook ,  Boeing  and McDonald's are among about 140 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting first quarter results.    Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down.  Stocks were slightly higher Friday, but the market was heading for its first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The  S&amp;P 500  has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia's plan to reopen.  Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%.  ""If you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it's a fundamental story,"" said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. ""The fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.""  Golub said it's the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that's being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. ""People are watching what's going on in places like Georgia, but they're also watching what's going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, there's really one thing that really matters. It's not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.""     Fed bazooka   The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it's not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity.  ""I'm anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,"" said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. ""I think we're going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what's working and the things that still need to happen.""  Tilley said the Fed's job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. ""It looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they've come back in,"" he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program.  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank's ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%.   Golub said this Fed meeting isn't as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed.   ""The Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they're not going to wait for a meeting to do it,"" he said. ""Whether you're borrowing from a bank or whether you're borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.""    Economic impact   First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%.  Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production.  The impact of that should show up in Friday's April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday's weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits.  So far,  26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed i n the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off.  ""We'll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,""  Tilley said.   Earnings    Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense.  Merck,   Pfizer ,  AstraZeneca ,  Humana  and  Anthem  are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies,  Exxon Mobil  and  Chevron  both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important.  An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for  West Texas Intermediate  was at $16.78 per barrel Friday afternoon, about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures.  ""The most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It's how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,"" said Golub. ""My estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it's going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year. I think that's too optimistic.The second part of the earnings story is how fast estimates are coming down.""  He said first quarter earnings per share look to be down a little more than 12%, though some estimates have them down 16% or 17%. ""We had 10 very healthy weeks and three not healthy weeks. The fact you could have such a negative quarter with only three bad week, that's really bad."" Golub said. His forecast is for a 40% decline in second quarter profits.

In the past, Apple has ignored claims Trump has made about the company or private conversations with Cook.  The coronavirus has rattled markets for the majority of the year as investors grapple with its economic consequences. The virus has  sickened more than 2.7 million people  worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.                       Shares of Apple began to sink in February, when the company warned it did not expect to meet its quarterly revenue forecast, citing slowed production and weakened demand in China as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.   Shares then cratered again in mid-March as part of a broad market sell off and after the  Nikkei Asian Review reported  that the company considered delaying its annual iPhone launch by months. Apple announced its newest, cheaper iPhone model, the iPhone SE, on April 15. The company has gained some of that drop back in April. Since January, Apple shares are down nearly 4.5%.

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images       Apple  and  Google  announced new updates on Friday to their proposed system that will enable iOS and Android phones trace the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus.  The updated system includes security and privacy enhancements that representatives from governments and public health authorities have asked for, the companies said.    In April, Apple and Google  announced  plans to build new technology into iOS and Android to make it possible to make contact tracing apps, which will track when people have been in close proximity to somebody who has tested positive for coronavirus, and allow public health officials to notify them that they might have been exposed. The system, which uses the Bluetooth short-range wireless technology built into both operating systems, is likely to power efforts by governments around the world efforts to use signals picked up from smartphones to alert people who may have been exposed to someone infected with Covid-19.   Apple and Google aren't building the apps. Contact tracing apps will be built deployed by public health officials, and both Apple and Google's app stores have restrictions around coronavirus apps that aren't from a recognized authority. Apple and Google's APIs will become available in mid-May, the companies previously said.  On Friday, the companies changed the terminology they're using to describe the system, calling it ""exposure notification,"" as opposed to ""contact tracing."" They did this to differentiate it from traditional contact tracing practices in public health organizations, which rely on people to make lots of phone calls to warn people that they may have been exposed to someone with Covid-19.  Technical changes to Apple and Google's system on Friday include:   It can now share the strength and duration of a Bluetooth signal so that the apps can make a better judgment of who someone has been in contact with.   It can now alert people about the number of days since they were potentially exposed.   The security around random keys and and the way the system handles Bluetooth metadata has been improved.   Governments are now pressing Apple to lift some of these privacy provisions so that they can build apps in conjunction with a centralized database, which would allow human contact tracers working for the government to call people and tell them they might have been exposed. (The way the Apple-Google system is set up, potentially infected people would simply get an alert on their phones, but could remain anonymous if they choose.) Governments could build these kinds of contact tracing apps without Apple's API, but they would need to stay active and running in the background on an iPhone to work, which can drain battery life and make the app unworkable.    French Digital Minister Cedric O  said earlier this week  that he's asked Apple to lift the technical restrictions on Bluetooth so that they can build the app. Germany has also asked Apple to loosen the Bluetooth restriction,  according to Reuters .  Apple is not planning to loosen the iPhone's system limitations, which were built to protect user privacy, a representative said.   The system will be distributed to iPhones that can run iOS 13, which includes phones released in 2015 and after, and to Android phones running Android 6.0 or later that can get updates to Google services, representatives said.   In the United States, public health is a county and state function, and few digitally-focused contact tracing programs have been officially announced yet. In Europe, several countries have discussed release dates and public development of their apps, with the first targeted in May.

San Francisco-based security firm ZecOps on Wednesday detailed a flaw that it said may have left more than half a billion iPhones vulnerable to hackers.    Zuk Avraham, ZecOps' chief executive, told Reuters he found evidence the vulnerability was exploited in at least six cybersecurity break-ins.  Avraham said he found evidence that an attacker was taking advantage of the vulnerability as far back as January 2018, but that he could not determine who the hackers were.  Reuters was unable to independently verify his claim.  Apple on Wednesday acknowledged the vulnerability existed in its software for email on iPhones and iPads, known as the Mail app, and said the company had developed a fix that will be introduced in a forthcoming update to millions of devices it has sold globally.  On Thursday, Apple disputed Avraham's evidence that the hack had been used against iPhone users.    ""We have thoroughly investigated the researcher's report and, based on the information provided, have concluded these issues do not pose an immediate risk to our users,"" Apple said in a statement. ""The researcher identified three issues in Mail, but alone they are insufficient to bypass iPhone and iPad security protections, and we have found no evidence they were used against customers.""  Avraham did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Apple's statement.     "
