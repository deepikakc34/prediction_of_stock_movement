The new high-end iPhone design will look more like the iPhone 5, Bloomberg says, with \"flat stainless steel edges,\" and the screen on the larger version will be slightly bigger than the 6.5-inch display found on the current iPhone 11 Pro Max. It could also feature a smaller version of the current 'notch' camera cutout in at the top end of the display, the report claims.\n",

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google are teaming up to help trace contacts of COVID-19 positive smartphone users using Bluetooth technology while maintaining privacy.What Happened On Friday, Apple and Google announced a joint project to launch a \"comprehensive solution,\" which will include application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating system level-technology to carry out contact tracing.The contact-tracing solution would help healthcare workers in the fight against COVID-19, as the disease spreads through people in close proximity.According to a statement released by Apple, both companies will release APIs in May, to ensure interoperability on both iOS and Android platforms. A \"broader\" Bluetooth-based contact platform will follow, seeking to build the functionality on both mobile platforms.In a joint statement, the tech giants said, \"Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.\"Why It Matters Each phone will transmit a unique and anonymous code over Bluetooth. The contact-tracing system will register the phones in its vicinity in a log. Over the long term, all phones will build a log of smartphones they have exchanged this code with, according to the Verge.  Anyone testing positive for COVID-19  would be able to submit a positive diagnosis to a central database through their healthcare provider. The patient's registered database contacts would then be alerted that they'd been exposed to the virus.The system will be built into existing public health apps built by state-level health agencies. Eventually, the capability would be baked into the respective operating systems themselves.Google and Apple have published details on how the contact-tracing works.Participation in the contact-tracing program is voluntary. Users can turn off the tracing or skip participating by not downloading the relevant public health applications.As of December 2019, Android and iOS combined have a 99% share of the global mobile operating system market share, according to Statista, a German online statistics portal.Price Action On Thursday, Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 in the regular session.Alphabet class A shares traded 0.036% lower at $1,206.57, while the company's class C shares traded 0.097% higher at $1,211.45 in the regular session.See more from Benzinga  * Fed President Warns Of 'Long Hard Road' Ahead, Suggests 18-Month Strategy To Recover From Coronavirus Outbreak  * Wuhan-Based Company Can Now Produce The Same 128-Layer Chip Samsung Does  * WeWork Fails To Pay Rent At Several US Locations: Report(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPLE) has the \"brightest\" future of all technology giants, even if the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has temporarily impacted the company's business, Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a note Sunday.What Happened According to Munster, Apple will also outperform the rest of FAANG stocks, which include Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

A \"broader\" Bluetooth-based contact platform will follow, seeking to build the functionality on both mobile platforms.In a joint statement, the tech giants said, \"Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.\"Why It Matters Each phone will transmit a unique and anonymous code over Bluetooth. The contact-tracing system will register the phones in its vicinity in a log. Over the long term, all phones will build a log of smartphones they have exchanged this code with, according to the Verge.  Anyone testing positive for COVID-19  would be able to submit a positive diagnosis to a central database through their healthcare provider.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",

(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

A \"broader\" Bluetooth-based contact platform will follow, seeking to build the functionality on both mobile platforms.In a joint statement, the tech giants said, \"Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.\"Why It Matters Each phone will transmit a unique and anonymous code over Bluetooth. The contact-tracing system will register the phones in its vicinity in a log. Over the long term, all phones will build a log of smartphones they have exchanged this code with, according to the Verge.  Anyone testing positive for COVID-19  would be able to submit a positive diagnosis to a central database through their healthcare provider.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",

(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google are teaming up to help trace contacts of COVID-19 positive smartphone users using Bluetooth technology while maintaining privacy.What Happened On Friday, Apple and Google announced a joint project to launch a \"comprehensive solution,\" which will include application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating system level-technology to carry out contact tracing.The contact-tracing solution would help healthcare workers in the fight against COVID-19, as the disease spreads through people in close proximity.According to a statement released by Apple, both companies will release APIs in May, to ensure interoperability on both iOS and Android platforms. A \"broader\" Bluetooth-based contact platform will follow, seeking to build the functionality on both mobile platforms.In a joint statement, the tech giants said, \"Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.\"Why It Matters Each phone will transmit a unique and anonymous code over Bluetooth. The contact-tracing system will register the phones in its vicinity in a log. Over the long term, all phones will build a log of smartphones they have exchanged this code with, according to the Verge.  Anyone testing positive for COVID-19  would be able to submit a positive diagnosis to a central database through their healthcare provider. The patient's registered database contacts would then be alerted that they'd been exposed to the virus.The system will be built into existing public health apps built by state-level health agencies. Eventually, the capability would be baked into the respective operating systems themselves.Google and Apple have published details on how the contact-tracing works.Participation in the contact-tracing program is voluntary. Users can turn off the tracing or skip participating by not downloading the relevant public health applications.As of December 2019, Android and iOS combined have a 99% share of the global mobile operating system market share, according to Statista, a German online statistics portal.Price Action On Thursday, Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 in the regular session.Alphabet class A shares traded 0.036% lower at $1,206.57, while the company's class C shares traded 0.097% higher at $1,211.45 in the regular session.See more from Benzinga  * Fed President Warns Of 'Long Hard Road' Ahead, Suggests 18-Month Strategy To Recover From Coronavirus Outbreak  * Wuhan-Based Company Can Now Produce The Same 128-Layer Chip Samsung Does  * WeWork Fails To Pay Rent At Several US Locations: Report(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPLE) has the \"brightest\" future of all technology giants, even if the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has temporarily impacted the company's business, Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a note Sunday.What Happened According to Munster, Apple will also outperform the rest of FAANG stocks, which include Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

A \"broader\" Bluetooth-based contact platform will follow, seeking to build the functionality on both mobile platforms.In a joint statement, the tech giants said, \"Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.\"Why It Matters Each phone will transmit a unique and anonymous code over Bluetooth. The contact-tracing system will register the phones in its vicinity in a log. Over the long term, all phones will build a log of smartphones they have exchanged this code with, according to the Verge.  Anyone testing positive for COVID-19  would be able to submit a positive diagnosis to a central database through their healthcare provider. The patient's registered database contacts would then be alerted that they'd been exposed to the virus.The system will be built into existing public health apps built by state-level health agencies. Eventually, the capability would be baked into the respective operating systems themselves.Google and Apple have published details on how the contact-tracing works.Participation in the contact-tracing program is voluntary. Users can turn off the tracing or skip participating by not downloading the relevant public health applications.As of December 2019, Android and iOS combined have a 99% share of the global mobile operating system market share, according to Statista, a German online statistics portal.Price Action On Thursday, Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 in the regular session.Alphabet class A shares traded 0.036% lower at $1,206.57, while the company's class C shares traded 0.097% higher at $1,211.45 in the regular session.See more from Benzinga  * Fed President Warns Of 'Long Hard Road' Ahead, Suggests 18-Month Strategy To Recover From Coronavirus Outbreak  * Wuhan-Based Company Can Now Produce The Same 128-Layer Chip Samsung Does  * WeWork Fails To Pay Rent At Several US Locations: Report(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPLE) has the \"brightest\" future of all technology giants, even if the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has temporarily impacted the company's business, Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a note Sunday.What Happened According to Munster, Apple will also outperform the rest of FAANG stocks, which include Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google are teaming up to help trace contacts of COVID-19 positive smartphone users using Bluetooth technology while maintaining privacy.What Happened On Friday, Apple and Google announced a joint project to launch a \"comprehensive solution,\" which will include application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating system level-technology to carry out contact tracing.The contact-tracing solution would help healthcare workers in the fight against COVID-19, as the disease spreads through people in close proximity.According to a statement released by Apple, both companies will release APIs in May, to ensure interoperability on both iOS and Android platforms. A \"broader\" Bluetooth-based contact platform will follow, seeking to build the functionality on both mobile platforms.In a joint statement, the tech giants said, \"Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.\"Why It Matters Each phone will transmit a unique and anonymous code over Bluetooth. The contact-tracing system will register the phones in its vicinity in a log. Over the long term, all phones will build a log of smartphones they have exchanged this code with, according to the Verge.  Anyone testing positive for COVID-19  would be able to submit a positive diagnosis to a central database through their healthcare provider. The patient's registered database contacts would then be alerted that they'd been exposed to the virus.The system will be built into existing public health apps built by state-level health agencies. Eventually, the capability would be baked into the respective operating systems themselves.Google and Apple have published details on how the contact-tracing works.Participation in the contact-tracing program is voluntary. Users can turn off the tracing or skip participating by not downloading the relevant public health applications.As of December 2019, Android and iOS combined have a 99% share of the global mobile operating system market share, according to Statista, a German online statistics portal.Price Action On Thursday, Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 in the regular session.Alphabet class A shares traded 0.036% lower at $1,206.57, while the company's class C shares traded 0.097% higher at $1,211.45 in the regular session.See more from Benzinga  * Fed President Warns Of 'Long Hard Road' Ahead, Suggests 18-Month Strategy To Recover From Coronavirus Outbreak  * Wuhan-Based Company Can Now Produce The Same 128-Layer Chip Samsung Does  * WeWork Fails To Pay Rent At Several US Locations: Report(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPLE) has the \"brightest\" future of all technology giants, even if the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has temporarily impacted the company's business, Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a note Sunday.What Happened According to Munster, Apple will also outperform the rest of FAANG stocks, which include Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google are teaming up to help trace contacts of COVID-19 positive smartphone users using Bluetooth technology while maintaining privacy.What Happened On Friday, Apple and Google announced a joint project to launch a \"comprehensive solution,\" which will include application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating system level-technology to carry out contact tracing.The contact-tracing solution would help healthcare workers in the fight against COVID-19, as the disease spreads through people in close proximity.According to a statement released by Apple, both companies will release APIs in May, to ensure interoperability on both iOS and Android platforms. A \"broader\" Bluetooth-based contact platform will follow, seeking to build the functionality on both mobile platforms.In a joint statement, the tech giants said, \"Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.\"Why It Matters Each phone will transmit a unique and anonymous code over Bluetooth. The contact-tracing system will register the phones in its vicinity in a log. Over the long term, all phones will build a log of smartphones they have exchanged this code with, according to the Verge.  Anyone testing positive for COVID-19  would be able to submit a positive diagnosis to a central database through their healthcare provider. The patient's registered database contacts would then be alerted that they'd been exposed to the virus.The system will be built into existing public health apps built by state-level health agencies. Eventually, the capability would be baked into the respective operating systems themselves.Google and Apple have published details on how the contact-tracing works.Participation in the contact-tracing program is voluntary. Users can turn off the tracing or skip participating by not downloading the relevant public health applications.As of December 2019, Android and iOS combined have a 99% share of the global mobile operating system market share, according to Statista, a German online statistics portal.Price Action On Thursday, Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 in the regular session.Alphabet class A shares traded 0.036% lower at $1,206.57, while the company's class C shares traded 0.097% higher at $1,211.45 in the regular session.See more from Benzinga  * Fed President Warns Of 'Long Hard Road' Ahead, Suggests 18-Month Strategy To Recover From Coronavirus Outbreak  * Wuhan-Based Company Can Now Produce The Same 128-Layer Chip Samsung Does  * WeWork Fails To Pay Rent At Several US Locations: Report(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPLE) has the \"brightest\" future of all technology giants, even if the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has temporarily impacted the company's business, Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a note Sunday.What Happened According to Munster, Apple will also outperform the rest of FAANG stocks, which include Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPLE) has the \"brightest\" future of all technology giants, even if the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has temporarily impacted the company's business, Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a note Sunday.What Happened According to Munster, Apple will also outperform the rest of FAANG stocks, which include Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPLE) has the \"brightest\" future of all technology giants, even if the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has temporarily impacted the company's business, Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a note Sunday.What Happened According to Munster, Apple will also outperform the rest of FAANG stocks, which include Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPLE) has the \"brightest\" future of all technology giants, even if the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has temporarily impacted the company's business, Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a note Sunday.What Happened According to Munster, Apple will also outperform the rest of FAANG stocks, which include Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPLE) has the \"brightest\" future of all technology giants, even if the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has temporarily impacted the company's business, Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a note Sunday.What Happened According to Munster, Apple will also outperform the rest of FAANG stocks, which include Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

A \"broader\" Bluetooth-based contact platform will follow, seeking to build the functionality on both mobile platforms.In a joint statement, the tech giants said, \"Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.\"Why It Matters Each phone will transmit a unique and anonymous code over Bluetooth. The contact-tracing system will register the phones in its vicinity in a log. Over the long term, all phones will build a log of smartphones they have exchanged this code with, according to the Verge.  Anyone testing positive for COVID-19  would be able to submit a positive diagnosis to a central database through their healthcare provider.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPLE) has the \"brightest\" future of all technology giants, even if the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has temporarily impacted the company's business, Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a note Sunday.What Happened According to Munster, Apple will also outperform the rest of FAANG stocks, which include Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

A \"broader\" Bluetooth-based contact platform will follow, seeking to build the functionality on both mobile platforms.In a joint statement, the tech giants said, \"Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.\"Why It Matters Each phone will transmit a unique and anonymous code over Bluetooth. The contact-tracing system will register the phones in its vicinity in a log. Over the long term, all phones will build a log of smartphones they have exchanged this code with, according to the Verge.  Anyone testing positive for COVID-19  would be able to submit a positive diagnosis to a central database through their healthcare provider.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",

(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

A \"broader\" Bluetooth-based contact platform will follow, seeking to build the functionality on both mobile platforms.In a joint statement, the tech giants said, \"Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.\"Why It Matters Each phone will transmit a unique and anonymous code over Bluetooth. The contact-tracing system will register the phones in its vicinity in a log. Over the long term, all phones will build a log of smartphones they have exchanged this code with, according to the Verge.  Anyone testing positive for COVID-19  would be able to submit a positive diagnosis to a central database through their healthcare provider.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",

(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google are teaming up to help trace contacts of COVID-19 positive smartphone users using Bluetooth technology while maintaining privacy.What Happened On Friday, Apple and Google announced a joint project to launch a \"comprehensive solution,\" which will include application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating system level-technology to carry out contact tracing.The contact-tracing solution would help healthcare workers in the fight against COVID-19, as the disease spreads through people in close proximity.According to a statement released by Apple, both companies will release APIs in May, to ensure interoperability on both iOS and Android platforms. A \"broader\" Bluetooth-based contact platform will follow, seeking to build the functionality on both mobile platforms.In a joint statement, the tech giants said, \"Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.\"Why It Matters Each phone will transmit a unique and anonymous code over Bluetooth. The contact-tracing system will register the phones in its vicinity in a log. Over the long term, all phones will build a log of smartphones they have exchanged this code with, according to the Verge.  Anyone testing positive for COVID-19  would be able to submit a positive diagnosis to a central database through their healthcare provider. The patient's registered database contacts would then be alerted that they'd been exposed to the virus.The system will be built into existing public health apps built by state-level health agencies. Eventually, the capability would be baked into the respective operating systems themselves.Google and Apple have published details on how the contact-tracing works.Participation in the contact-tracing program is voluntary. Users can turn off the tracing or skip participating by not downloading the relevant public health applications.As of December 2019, Android and iOS combined have a 99% share of the global mobile operating system market share, according to Statista, a German online statistics portal.Price Action On Thursday, Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 in the regular session.Alphabet class A shares traded 0.036% lower at $1,206.57, while the company's class C shares traded 0.097% higher at $1,211.45 in the regular session.See more from Benzinga  * Fed President Warns Of 'Long Hard Road' Ahead, Suggests 18-Month Strategy To Recover From Coronavirus Outbreak  * Wuhan-Based Company Can Now Produce The Same 128-Layer Chip Samsung Does  * WeWork Fails To Pay Rent At Several US Locations: Report(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPLE) has the \"brightest\" future of all technology giants, even if the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has temporarily impacted the company's business, Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a note Sunday.What Happened According to Munster, Apple will also outperform the rest of FAANG stocks, which include Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

A \"broader\" Bluetooth-based contact platform will follow, seeking to build the functionality on both mobile platforms.In a joint statement, the tech giants said, \"Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.\"Why It Matters Each phone will transmit a unique and anonymous code over Bluetooth. The contact-tracing system will register the phones in its vicinity in a log. Over the long term, all phones will build a log of smartphones they have exchanged this code with, according to the Verge.  Anyone testing positive for COVID-19  would be able to submit a positive diagnosis to a central database through their healthcare provider. The patient's registered database contacts would then be alerted that they'd been exposed to the virus.The system will be built into existing public health apps built by state-level health agencies. Eventually, the capability would be baked into the respective operating systems themselves.Google and Apple have published details on how the contact-tracing works.Participation in the contact-tracing program is voluntary. Users can turn off the tracing or skip participating by not downloading the relevant public health applications.As of December 2019, Android and iOS combined have a 99% share of the global mobile operating system market share, according to Statista, a German online statistics portal.Price Action On Thursday, Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 in the regular session.Alphabet class A shares traded 0.036% lower at $1,206.57, while the company's class C shares traded 0.097% higher at $1,211.45 in the regular session.See more from Benzinga  * Fed President Warns Of 'Long Hard Road' Ahead, Suggests 18-Month Strategy To Recover From Coronavirus Outbreak  * Wuhan-Based Company Can Now Produce The Same 128-Layer Chip Samsung Does  * WeWork Fails To Pay Rent At Several US Locations: Report(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPLE) has the \"brightest\" future of all technology giants, even if the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has temporarily impacted the company's business, Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a note Sunday.What Happened According to Munster, Apple will also outperform the rest of FAANG stocks, which include Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google are teaming up to help trace contacts of COVID-19 positive smartphone users using Bluetooth technology while maintaining privacy.What Happened On Friday, Apple and Google announced a joint project to launch a \"comprehensive solution,\" which will include application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating system level-technology to carry out contact tracing.The contact-tracing solution would help healthcare workers in the fight against COVID-19, as the disease spreads through people in close proximity.According to a statement released by Apple, both companies will release APIs in May, to ensure interoperability on both iOS and Android platforms. A \"broader\" Bluetooth-based contact platform will follow, seeking to build the functionality on both mobile platforms.In a joint statement, the tech giants said, \"Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.\"Why It Matters Each phone will transmit a unique and anonymous code over Bluetooth. The contact-tracing system will register the phones in its vicinity in a log. Over the long term, all phones will build a log of smartphones they have exchanged this code with, according to the Verge.  Anyone testing positive for COVID-19  would be able to submit a positive diagnosis to a central database through their healthcare provider. The patient's registered database contacts would then be alerted that they'd been exposed to the virus.The system will be built into existing public health apps built by state-level health agencies. Eventually, the capability would be baked into the respective operating systems themselves.Google and Apple have published details on how the contact-tracing works.Participation in the contact-tracing program is voluntary. Users can turn off the tracing or skip participating by not downloading the relevant public health applications.As of December 2019, Android and iOS combined have a 99% share of the global mobile operating system market share, according to Statista, a German online statistics portal.Price Action On Thursday, Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 in the regular session.Alphabet class A shares traded 0.036% lower at $1,206.57, while the company's class C shares traded 0.097% higher at $1,211.45 in the regular session.See more from Benzinga  * Fed President Warns Of 'Long Hard Road' Ahead, Suggests 18-Month Strategy To Recover From Coronavirus Outbreak  * Wuhan-Based Company Can Now Produce The Same 128-Layer Chip Samsung Does  * WeWork Fails To Pay Rent At Several US Locations: Report(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPLE) has the \"brightest\" future of all technology giants, even if the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has temporarily impacted the company's business, Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a note Sunday.What Happened According to Munster, Apple will also outperform the rest of FAANG stocks, which include Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google are teaming up to help trace contacts of COVID-19 positive smartphone users using Bluetooth technology while maintaining privacy.What Happened On Friday, Apple and Google announced a joint project to launch a \"comprehensive solution,\" which will include application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating system level-technology to carry out contact tracing.The contact-tracing solution would help healthcare workers in the fight against COVID-19, as the disease spreads through people in close proximity.According to a statement released by Apple, both companies will release APIs in May, to ensure interoperability on both iOS and Android platforms. A \"broader\" Bluetooth-based contact platform will follow, seeking to build the functionality on both mobile platforms.In a joint statement, the tech giants said, \"Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.\"Why It Matters Each phone will transmit a unique and anonymous code over Bluetooth. The contact-tracing system will register the phones in its vicinity in a log. Over the long term, all phones will build a log of smartphones they have exchanged this code with, according to the Verge.  Anyone testing positive for COVID-19  would be able to submit a positive diagnosis to a central database through their healthcare provider. The patient's registered database contacts would then be alerted that they'd been exposed to the virus.The system will be built into existing public health apps built by state-level health agencies. Eventually, the capability would be baked into the respective operating systems themselves.Google and Apple have published details on how the contact-tracing works.Participation in the contact-tracing program is voluntary. Users can turn off the tracing or skip participating by not downloading the relevant public health applications.As of December 2019, Android and iOS combined have a 99% share of the global mobile operating system market share, according to Statista, a German online statistics portal.Price Action On Thursday, Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 in the regular session.Alphabet class A shares traded 0.036% lower at $1,206.57, while the company's class C shares traded 0.097% higher at $1,211.45 in the regular session.See more from Benzinga  * Fed President Warns Of 'Long Hard Road' Ahead, Suggests 18-Month Strategy To Recover From Coronavirus Outbreak  * Wuhan-Based Company Can Now Produce The Same 128-Layer Chip Samsung Does  * WeWork Fails To Pay Rent At Several US Locations: Report(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPLE) has the \"brightest\" future of all technology giants, even if the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has temporarily impacted the company's business, Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a note Sunday.What Happened According to Munster, Apple will also outperform the rest of FAANG stocks, which include Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPLE) has the \"brightest\" future of all technology giants, even if the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has temporarily impacted the company's business, Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a note Sunday.What Happened According to Munster, Apple will also outperform the rest of FAANG stocks, which include Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A multi-millionaire CEO who steps down just before an economic crisis might not want to look back. But Bob Iger, who never made a clean break from the Walt Disney Co., appears to be retaking the reins from his ill-fated successor. It’s Iger’s chance to rethink what the company he made into a media and entertainment juggernaut — now battered all around by the pandemic and grappling with a new media business model — looks like in the end when he eventually does leave it behind. That could involve dismantling some of what he proudly built during his more than four decades at the company in order to now create a Disney better suited for the new normal.After 15 years as CEO and an ever-fluid retirement date, Iger abruptly relinquished the title in February, staying on in a somewhat undefined role as executive chairman. Bob Chapek, a longtime Disney executive who had been running the parks and cruises side of the company, stepped into his shoes. It was seven weeks ago, and yet the world was so different: Americans could still go to work, Disney’s domestic theme parks were bustling, toilet paper hoarding was only just beginning and for many, the coronavirus outbreak was something to hear or read about on the news rather than a lived experienced. Then, suddenly, as the pandemic shut down wide swathes of the U.S. economy and took particular aim at some of  Disney's core businesses, a momentous retirement that seemed like it’d never arrive was instead happening all too quickly. Technically, there is a new Bob at the helm of the $182 billion conglomerate now; in reality, he’s known as “Bob C,” secondary to the true “Bob” — Iger, according to a New York Times article Monday that gave an inside look at how the succession plan may be unexpectedly reverting. (Then again, Disney never was known for its clean CEO transitions.) In scary times like these, businesses need clear leadership, and despite what may have been Chapek’s best efforts, Iger’s is still the voice that matters.It’s also a chance for Iger to take care of some unfinished business. While he was personally focused on acquisitions in recent years to add to Disney’s storied brands — Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” — and making investments in the future of content delivery, the theme parks had become a fairly predictable, if sometimes overshadowed, business. Now, that division has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, and unlike the last financial crisis and recession, this one may not have the promise of a return to normal.At Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been closed for about a month, the company plans to furlough 43,000 workers. And there’s no telling when its attractions can reopen, or how long before consumers are comfortable returning to crowded venues or cruise ships again. Disney had already been in the process of expanding its four-ship cruise line with three more vessels.Forecasts of Disney’s overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending in September have fallen sharply, from almost $18 billion in January, to just under $13 billion now. According to the Times, industry analyst Hal Vogel estimates Disney is losing $30 million or more a day. It earned about $31 million a day in operating profit in 2019. Disney has managed to sign up more than 50 million paying customers for Disney+, the Netflix-like streaming product it launched in November. That’s a significant achievement in a short period of time. However, with Hollywood studio productions shut down for the time being, the criticism that Disney+ doesn’t have enough fresh content will only become more valid. The service also won’t begin making money for a couple more years.As it was, the pivot to streaming had thrown the future of Disney’s lucrative media networks into question. Now, with no live sports to air or discuss on ESPN, the network is looking even more like an awkward fit within Disney. I once suggested that Iger spin off ESPN, and several years later it still doesn’t seem too complicated to do. Even the network’s own direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN+, has been the weaker sibling of Disney+ and Hulu, so much so that the company’s $13-a-month streaming subscription bundle essentially gives away the sports app for free. In recent years, Disney has ruled the box office, and it will again once cinemas reopen and movie sets get back to work. The question is whether consumers, after spending so much time home and expecting immediate access to new films, will be broken of the habit of visiting theaters — or if Disney’s superhero and galactic blockbusters will always be enough of a draw. It’s all this and more that Iger will be contemplating. In his business memoir released last year, “The Ride of a Lifetime,” Iger wrote that he believes Disney and Apple Inc. would have become one if Steve Jobs were still alive. Looking ahead to Disney’s post-pandemic future, the company may look smaller, both in terms of business units and employees — although staff reductions are sure to be a prickly topic for a CEO who, even with his admirable track record, was criticized toward the end for being overpaid. What’s unclear is how Bob C feels about any of this, or if that even matters if Bob is still running the show.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

      "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an extraordinary attempt to help the economy in the midst of the coronavirus economic downturn, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $6 trillion.How this has affected fixed-income pricing, yield, risk and even trading is the subject of this week’s Masters in Business interview with John R. Mousseau, president, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. Mousseau also is the co-author of the book “Adventures in Muniland: A Guide to Municipal Bond Investing in the Post-Crisis Era.”He notes the current slump is very different from the 2008-09 financial crisis. That event was driven by credit deterioration and mortgage defaults. Things only came to a head only after defaults soared and bond markets developed liquidity problems after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In the fixed-income world today, the coronavirus pandemic is characterized mostly by economic paralysis, but so far not mass defaults.The recent bond market turmoil was driven not so much by fundamentals as by the 35% crash in stocks. People sell what they can, not what they would like, when they are desperate to raise cash.Mousseau explains why credit quality is always relative and what this means for total-return bond management. He likens the bond market to a ship hit by a torpedo but still sailing on with the support of Congressional fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary stimulus. Among other things, he believes high-quality general obligation municipals bonds will be fine.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras, on Apple iTunes, Spotify, Overcast, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

Anyone testing positive for COVID-19  would be able to submit a positive diagnosis to a central database through their healthcare provider. The patient's registered database contacts would then be alerted that they'd been exposed to the virus.The system will be built into existing public health apps built by state-level health agencies. Eventually, the capability would be baked into the respective operating systems themselves.Google and Apple have published details on how the contact-tracing works.Participation in the contact-tracing program is voluntary. Users can turn off the tracing or skip participating by not downloading the relevant public health applications.As of December 2019, Android and iOS combined have a 99% share of the global mobile operating system market share, according to Statista, a German online statistics portal.Price Action On Thursday, Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 in the regular session.Alphabet class A shares traded 0.036% lower at $1,206.57, while the company's class C shares traded 0.097% higher at $1,211.45 in the regular session.See more from Benzinga  * Fed President Warns Of 'Long Hard Road' Ahead, Suggests 18-Month Strategy To Recover From Coronavirus Outbreak  * Wuhan-Based Company Can Now Produce The Same 128-Layer Chip Samsung Does  * WeWork Fails To Pay Rent At Several US Locations: Report(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed aging, inflexible computer systems at the heart of the U.S. economy -- and a shortage of experts to fix the problem. This is slowing the government’s effort to get billions of dollars in stimulus checks to millions of newly unemployed citizens.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March includes a $600 weekly increase in unemployment benefits. That money won’t reach anyone until state agencies update technology systems to reflect the law and handle the flood of new applications.Oklahoma is trying to implement CARES as quickly as it can, but some claims are taking as long as two weeks to process because of a mainframe computer that runs on a 60-year-old programming language called COBOL.“It is the largest issue with regards to implementation in the CARES program,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. “Our mainframe is literally over 30 years old. It’s very difficult to program, it doesn’t do much. COBOL programmers are somewhat scarce.”Roberson started her job nine weeks ago with a mandate to upgrade the system, but the pandemic hit before any real progress was made. Other agencies in Oklahoma and beyond are suffering from similar problems, she said.The Connecticut Department of Labor is telling people to be patient as it works with experts to update COBOL code to implement the government relief program. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy appealed for COBOL programmers to help the state with its computers earlier this month.This talent shortage has been building for years through a combination of techno-snobbery, limited formal training, an aging pool of experts, and a lack of employers willing to pay up for the few people who are still willing to do the work.“It’s a disaster,” said Mahmoud Ezzeldin, 75, who worked for decades on COBOL computer systems for insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Internal Revenue Service. “COBOL is difficult to learn and was not designed for the internet. College graduates like to learn something easier. I cannot blame them.”Ezzeldin, who lives near Washington D.C., is willing to volunteer to help ease the CARES computing crunch. But he’s retired. That’s a familiar tale. The average COBOL programmer is over 60, Gartner Inc. estimates. When the research firm counted in 2004, it found 2 million experts in the language and estimated that number was falling 5% a year. That compares with about 25 million software developers in total, according to UBS.Usually, the technology industry adjusts when demand for a programming language outstrips the supply of capable coders. Computer science courses have multiplied at colleges in recent years, and there are coding boot camps that quickly train people in Java, Python and other languages. But COBOL is different.The Common Business Oriented Language emerged at the end of the 1950s, before computer science was taught at universities. Without the embrace of academia, many COBOL programmers learned on the job at government agencies and in fields such as insurance, banking and airline reservations. They’re considered the blue collar workers of the tech industry.“I cannot really recommend current students study COBOL. All the work would be maintenance and wouldn’t be very inspiring,” said Gio Wiederhold, a retired professor from Stanford University, which educates thousands of computer scientists who go on to work at Silicon Valley tech giants such as Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. Wiederhold said Stanford never taught COBOL from the time he moved there in 1979.Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office mentioned COBOL 26 times in a report that urged multiple agencies to modernize critical legacy technology.There are 240 billion lines of COBOL code still being used, according to Phil Teplitzky, chief technology officer of HP Marin Group LLC, which helps companies make better use of old computing systems.There’s little documentation explaining how these systems were built decades ago, so government agencies and companies often relied on programmers remembering how it was done -- COBOL “folklore,” Teplitzky calls it. Many of these experts aren’t around anymore, and now that the CARES Act requires major code changes, few people know how to do it, he said.The way old COBOL code was written also makes it hard to update. Modern computing languages break programs into chunks, each with a specific purpose. COBOL programmers often weaved everything together, which means code changes can damage or disable other parts of the program. This phenomenon, known as spaghetti code, is more of an issue than any inherent difficulty in learning the language. But it makes the work hard and time-consuming.Most of the mainframe computers that run COBOL are made by International Business Machines Corp. The company has been trying to help customers find COBOL experts and convince new trainees to take over for years. Last week, it announced a new training course to teach COBOL to beginners and refresh experienced professionals.“A light is being shined on the fact that there are some critical systems that may not have been focused on,” said Barry Baker, an IBM vice president. “It’s a case of selling COBOL and older technology to kids as a means to work on stuff that makes a difference. This is stuff that matters.”Gartner analyst Thomas Klinect thinks companies and other organizations must do a better job recruiting people to keep these machines running. That includes paying more.“If you look at the postings, they have been entry-level positions which needed 20 years of experience,” he said. “They wanted to pay you $35,000.”Chuck Robbins, the 53-year-old chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he started his career as a COBOL programmer for the predecessor of Bank of America.“The good news is that, as I recall, COBOL wasn’t one of the more difficult languages,” he said. “I’m sure some of these younger kids could figure it out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, borrowing cues from the latest iPads, as part of a major fall refresh that will see 5G added to as many as four new handset models and the release of two key new accessories, according to people familiar with the plans.This year’s successors to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be joined by two lower-end models to replace the iPhone 11. At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThis year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPLE) has the \"brightest\" future of all technology giants, even if the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has temporarily impacted the company's business, Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a note Sunday.What Happened According to Munster, Apple will also outperform the rest of FAANG stocks, which include Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in the financial year 2020.\"Apple is among the best-positioned major tech companies when we turn the corner,\" the former research analyst said.Munster noted that Apple has one of the strongest cash positions of all companies at $99 billion, second only to Google parent company Alphabet's $117 billion, helping it weather through the pandemic.In the long-term, the demand for its products and services is expected to increase based on pre-existing trends, the Loup Ventures co-founder predicted.These trends include 5G-based device upgrades, increased share in subscription video on demand sector with the Apple TV+ service, continued penetration of software services, rise in health wearables, and augmented reality \"emerging as the next major computing platform,\" according to Munster.\"Apple investors should rest easy,\" he said, forecasting a 12% revenue growth in the financial year 2021 at $277 billion, following a 5% slump this year.The consumer electronics company's GAAP earnings per share will rise 32% in FY21 at $15.12, compared to a 4% drop in FY20, Munster added.Why It Matters Apple downgraded its expectations for the second-quarter earnings of FY20 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in China, saying that both its supply chain and the demand for its products was severely impacted.The coronavirus, which has since infected 1.8 million people worldwide, forced the company to close all its retail outlets outside of China indefinitely.Other technology companies have been similarly impacted by the pandemic, but some, including Amazon and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have seen a rise in their business due to the pandemic.Price Action Apple shares closed 0.72% higher at $267.99 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Coronavirus Vaccine Developed In Short Time Unlikely To Be Safe, International Vaccine Institute Says  * Microsoft Delays Launch Of Dual-Screen Surface Neo To Next Year  * 'I Am Trying To Get More Cash': Why Mark Cuban Isn't Hopeful On US Market Rally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are planning to develop a contact-tracing software technology that will be added to their smartphones and seeks to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants will enable the use of bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies contain the spread of the virus, while user privacy and security are preserved, the two companies said in a joint statement.More specifically, the partnership will add technology to their smartphone platforms that will alert users if they have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected individual. Once users have been alerted, they will be told to go into quarantine. For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.The two tech giants said that the software technology, known as contact-tracing, will be built into their iPhones and Android devices in two steps. Initially in May, the two companies plan to release software technology to enable the exchange and use of information between Android and iPhones devices using apps from public health authorities.These official apps will then be available for users to download via their respective app stores. Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work on enabling a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, which would allow more individuals to participate.“Contact-tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy D. Cook said in a Twitter post.Wall Street analysts are bullish on Google’s Alphabet. In the last three months, Alphabet stock received 37 Buys and 1 Hold, according to TipRanks’ database. The average analyst price target of $1,554.38 implies 29% upside potential for investors in the coming 12 months. (See Alphabet’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, Jeff Kvaal analyst at Nomura last week raised Apple’s price target to $240 from $225, citing the tech giant’s \"robust\" ecosystem and \"strong\" balance sheet. At the same time though, Kvaal is sticking to his Hold rating saying that \"a looming recession and inflated supercycle expectations sufficiently undermine the bull case”.Overall, the majority of 26 analysts have a Buy rating for Apple, while 7 have a Hold rating and 2 have a Sell rating, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $311.70 average price target suggests potential gain of 16% in the shares. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Are Lockdowns Working?
