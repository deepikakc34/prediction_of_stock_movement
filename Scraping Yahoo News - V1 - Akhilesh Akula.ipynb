      "While Wedbush sees a difficult short-term trajectory for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), the sell-side firm said Thursday that Cupertino is staying on track with the launch schedule for its flagship product, the iPhone.  The Apple Analyst Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating on Apple with a $335 price target. What's Known About The iPhone 12 Apple is likely working on four iPhone 12 models,  with a mix of 4G and 5G phones that are likely to be launched between October and early December, just in time for the holiday season, Ives said in a Thursday note, citing supply chain checks in Asia. (See his track record here.)The analyst said he expects two versions of 5G phones, U.S. and non-U.S., with the U.S. version likely to have mmWave technology that could push out the production timeline.Many units could therefore be shifted to the March quarter, he said. Muted Expectations For Apple's Q2 Apple, which is scheduled to report its second-quarter results April 30 after the market closes, could report a dismal quarter and provide a bleak outlook for the June quarter amid COVID-19 pandemic-induced softness, Ives said.The analyst said the near-term demand picture around the world remains \"ominous\" due to the pandemic.  2021 Looks Promising For Apple, Wedbush Says Ives is optimistic concerning calendar year 2021.\"Now with the bad news out of the way, which we believe the Street will largely look through in terms of the stock, all the focus now shifts to iPhone 12, 5G, and the unit trajectory for September and heading into 1HFY21,\" the analyst said. Unit shipments of the iPhone could be around 165 million to 185 million in 2020, he said, citing Asia checks and supply chain contacts.Apple possesses strong underlying momentum into 2021 thanks to the imminent launch of the iPhone 12, according to Wedbush.

      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning to start selling Mac computers with its own main processors by next year, relying on designs that helped popularize the iPhone and iPad, according to people familiar with the matter.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on three of its own Mac processors, known as systems-on-a-chip, based on the A14 processor in the next iPhone. The first of these will be much faster than the processors in the iPhone and iPad, the people said.Apple is preparing to release at least one Mac with its own chip next year, according to the people. But the initiative to develop multiple chips, codenamed Kalamata, suggests the company will transition more of its Mac lineup away from current supplier Intel Corp.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Apple’s partner for iPhone and iPad processors, will build the new Mac chips, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private product plans. The components will be based on a 5-nanometer production technique, the same size Apple will use in the next iPhones and iPad Pros, one of the people said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment, as did Intel and TSMC.Apple is designing more of its own chips to gain greater control over the performance of its devices and differentiate them from rivals. Getting Macs, iPhones and iPads running the same underlying technology should make it easier for Apple to unify its apps ecosystem and update its computers more often. The move would also reduce reliance on Intel, which has struggled to maintain the annual increases in performance it once offered.“This news has negative longer-term implications for Intel, in-line with our concerns around Intel’s future market share,” Brad Gastwirth, chief technology strategist at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note to investors. Shares of the chipmaker fell as much as 2.2% on Thursday while the rest of the market rose.Read more: How Apple Built a Chip Powerhouse to Threaten Qualcomm and IntelCurrent mobile device chips from Apple have multiple processing units, or cores, that handle different types of tasks. The latest iPad Pro has four cores for performance-intensive workloads and another four to handle low-power tasks to preserve battery life.The first Mac processors will have eight high-performance cores, codenamed Firestorm, and at least four energy-efficient cores, known internally as Icestorm. Apple is exploring Mac processors with more than 12 cores for further in the future, the people said.In some Macs, Apple’s designs will double or quadruple the number of cores that Intel provides. The current entry-level MacBook Air has two cores, for example.Like Qualcomm Inc. and the rest of the mobile semiconductor industry, Apple designs its smartphone chips with technology from Arm Inc., owned by SoftBank Group Corp. These components often use less energy than Intel’s offerings. But it in recent years, Arm customers have tried to make processors that are also more powerful.The transition to in-house Apple processor designs would likely begin with a new laptop because the company’s first custom Mac chips won’t be able to rival the performance Intel provides for high-end MacBook Pros, iMacs and the Mac Pro desktop computer.The switch away from Intel is complex, requiring close collaboration between Apple’s software, hardware and component-sourcing teams. Given work-from-home orders and disruptions in the company’s Asia-based supply chain, the shift could be delayed, the people said.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyLike with the iPhone, Apple’s Mac processors will include several components, including the main processor, known as a Central Processing Unit or CPU, and the GPU, the graphics chip. Apple’s lower-end computers currently use Intel for graphics, while it has partnered with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for the graphics cards in its professional-focused offerings.The Kalamata project has been going for several years. In 2018, Apple developed a Mac chip based on the iPad Pro’s A12X processor for internal testing. That gave the company’s engineers confidence they could begin replacing Intel in Macs as early as 2020, Bloomberg News reported.Read more: Apple Said to Work on Mac Chip That Would Lessen Intel RoleApple has already started designing a second generation of Mac processors that follows the architecture of chips planned for the 2021 iPhone. That indicates Apple wants to put its Macs, iPhones and iPads on the same processor development cycle.Despite a unified chip design, Macs will still run the macOS operating system, rather than the iOS software of the iPhone and iPad. Apple is exploring tools that will ensure apps developed for older Intel-based Macs still work on the new machines. The company also has technology called Catalyst that lets software developers build an iPad app and run it on Mac computers.Moving macOS from Intel’s chip architecture to an Arm-based design will be a technical challenge. Microsoft Corp. stumbled with a similar effort.The changes will be a blow to Intel’s prestige. Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs and the late Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini stood on stage in 2005 to announce the first Macs with Intel processors. The decision was praised for several years, resulting in capable computers such as the original Mac Pro in 2006, the second-generation MacBook Air in 2010 and the thinner MacBook Pro in 2012.But in recent years, the pace of Mac upgrades has declined, partly due to a slowdown in Intel’s chip advancements. That sometimes left years between Mac refreshes, upsetting some customers. Intel has also faced manufacturing challenges that Apple has blamed for some recent declines in Mac sales.Read more: Intel’s Chipmaking Throne Is Challenged by Taiwanese UpstartKalamata is Apple’s most ambitious computer chip initiative to date. It currently offers specific chips for Mac features, such as security and power management, that work alongside the main Intel processors.Apple also aims to stop using Intel cellular modems -- chips that connect smartphones to the internet and support calls -- after using them for only four years. The company plans to use 5G modems from Qualcomm in as many as four new iPhone models later this year. Apple last year acquired Intel’s modem business after striking the short-term supply deal with Qualcomm.(Updates with shares, analyst reaction in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",
      "While some of its mega cap peers have been able to somewhat harness the COVID-19 pandemic to their advantage, the same cannot be said of Apple (APPL). The coronavirus’ effect on the supply chain and attendant macro impact have put a spanner in the works for the tech giant, disrupting laid out plans for 2020.The iPhone 12, Apple’s fanfare launch for 2020 - and first model to boast 5G capabilities - was originally slated for a fall release. But rumors have been circulating that due the pandemic and its impact on consumers’ spending power, the launch will go ahead later than originally expected.Nomura’s Jeff Kvaal believes \"the iPhone 12 is running four to six weeks behind plan.” Kvaal points out that the order changes are part of a wider revised plan for 2H20, which will amount to a “modest reduction in Apple’s build plans through calendar 2020.”The 5-star analyst noted, “The mix is now skewed to the iPhone 11/SE models. Apple’s order reset could also be 1) part of Apple’s commitment to suppliers and 2) concern that the pandemic could mute sales of higher-priced 5G phones. We retain our cautious view of a 5G supercycle. Replacement rates lengthened during the (more clearly beneficial) 4G cycle, and operators are now more targeted in their promotions.”Moreover, Kvaal expects further reductions, considering Apple’s history of cutting orders in phases. The analyst estimates the orders for CY20 will come in at 190 million, compared to the current estimates which suggest orders remains above 200 million.As a result, Kvaal reiterated a Hold rating on Apple shares, along with a $240 price target. The figure implies downside of 14% from current levels. (To watch Kvaal’s track record, click here)The Street, however, remains more upbeat. Apple’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 28 Buys, 6 Holds and 3 Sell ratings. The average price target comes in at $307.91 and could provide returns of 10%, should it be met over the coming months.

      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning to start selling Mac computers with its own main processors by next year, relying on designs that helped popularize the iPhone and iPad, according to people familiar with the matter.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on three of its own Mac processors, known as systems-on-a-chip, based on the A14 processor in the next iPhone. The first of these will be much faster than the processors in the iPhone and iPad, the people said.Apple is preparing to release at least one Mac with its own chip next year, according to the people. But the initiative to develop multiple chips, codenamed Kalamata, suggests the company will transition more of its Mac lineup away from current supplier Intel Corp.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Apple’s partner for iPhone and iPad processors, will build the new Mac chips, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private product plans. The components will be based on a 5-nanometer production technique, the same size Apple will use in the next iPhones and iPad Pros, one of the people said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment, as did Intel and TSMC.Apple is designing more of its own chips to gain greater control over the performance of its devices and differentiate them from rivals. Getting Macs, iPhones and iPads running the same underlying technology should make it easier for Apple to unify its apps ecosystem and update its computers more often. The move would also reduce reliance on Intel, which has struggled to maintain the annual increases in performance it once offered.“This news has negative longer-term implications for Intel, in-line with our concerns around Intel’s future market share,” Brad Gastwirth, chief technology strategist at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note to investors. Shares of the chipmaker fell as much as 2.2% on Thursday while the rest of the market rose.Read more: How Apple Built a Chip Powerhouse to Threaten Qualcomm and IntelCurrent mobile device chips from Apple have multiple processing units, or cores, that handle different types of tasks. The latest iPad Pro has four cores for performance-intensive workloads and another four to handle low-power tasks to preserve battery life.The first Mac processors will have eight high-performance cores, codenamed Firestorm, and at least four energy-efficient cores, known internally as Icestorm. Apple is exploring Mac processors with more than 12 cores for further in the future, the people said.In some Macs, Apple’s designs will double or quadruple the number of cores that Intel provides. The current entry-level MacBook Air has two cores, for example.Like Qualcomm Inc. and the rest of the mobile semiconductor industry, Apple designs its smartphone chips with technology from Arm Inc., owned by SoftBank Group Corp. These components often use less energy than Intel’s offerings. But it in recent years, Arm customers have tried to make processors that are also more powerful.The transition to in-house Apple processor designs would likely begin with a new laptop because the company’s first custom Mac chips won’t be able to rival the performance Intel provides for high-end MacBook Pros, iMacs and the Mac Pro desktop computer.The switch away from Intel is complex, requiring close collaboration between Apple’s software, hardware and component-sourcing teams. Given work-from-home orders and disruptions in the company’s Asia-based supply chain, the shift could be delayed, the people said.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyLike with the iPhone, Apple’s Mac processors will include several components, including the main processor, known as a Central Processing Unit or CPU, and the GPU, the graphics chip. Apple’s lower-end computers currently use Intel for graphics, while it has partnered with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for the graphics cards in its professional-focused offerings.The Kalamata project has been going for several years. In 2018, Apple developed a Mac chip based on the iPad Pro’s A12X processor for internal testing. That gave the company’s engineers confidence they could begin replacing Intel in Macs as early as 2020, Bloomberg News reported.Read more: Apple Said to Work on Mac Chip That Would Lessen Intel RoleApple has already started designing a second generation of Mac processors that follows the architecture of chips planned for the 2021 iPhone. That indicates Apple wants to put its Macs, iPhones and iPads on the same processor development cycle.Despite a unified chip design, Macs will still run the macOS operating system, rather than the iOS software of the iPhone and iPad. Apple is exploring tools that will ensure apps developed for older Intel-based Macs still work on the new machines. The company also has technology called Catalyst that lets software developers build an iPad app and run it on Mac computers.Moving macOS from Intel’s chip architecture to an Arm-based design will be a technical challenge. Microsoft Corp. stumbled with a similar effort.The changes will be a blow to Intel’s prestige. Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs and the late Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini stood on stage in 2005 to announce the first Macs with Intel processors. The decision was praised for several years, resulting in capable computers such as the original Mac Pro in 2006, the second-generation MacBook Air in 2010 and the thinner MacBook Pro in 2012.But in recent years, the pace of Mac upgrades has declined, partly due to a slowdown in Intel’s chip advancements.

      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning to start selling Mac computers with its own main processors by next year, relying on designs that helped popularize the iPhone and iPad, according to people familiar with the matter.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on three of its own Mac processors, known as systems-on-a-chip, based on the A14 processor in the next iPhone. The first of these will be much faster than the processors in the iPhone and iPad, the people said.Apple is preparing to release at least one Mac with its own chip next year, according to the people. But the initiative to develop multiple chips, codenamed Kalamata, suggests the company will transition more of its Mac lineup away from current supplier Intel Corp.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Apple’s partner for iPhone and iPad processors, will build the new Mac chips, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private product plans. The components will be based on a 5-nanometer production technique, the same size Apple will use in the next iPhones and iPad Pros, one of the people said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment, as did Intel and TSMC.Apple is designing more of its own chips to gain greater control over the performance of its devices and differentiate them from rivals. Getting Macs, iPhones and iPads running the same underlying technology should make it easier for Apple to unify its apps ecosystem and update its computers more often. The move would also reduce reliance on Intel, which has struggled to maintain the annual increases in performance it once offered.“This news has negative longer-term implications for Intel, in-line with our concerns around Intel’s future market share,” Brad Gastwirth, chief technology strategist at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note to investors. Shares of the chipmaker fell as much as 2.2% on Thursday while the rest of the market rose.Read more: How Apple Built a Chip Powerhouse to Threaten Qualcomm and IntelCurrent mobile device chips from Apple have multiple processing units, or cores, that handle different types of tasks. The latest iPad Pro has four cores for performance-intensive workloads and another four to handle low-power tasks to preserve battery life.The first Mac processors will have eight high-performance cores, codenamed Firestorm, and at least four energy-efficient cores, known internally as Icestorm. Apple is exploring Mac processors with more than 12 cores for further in the future, the people said.In some Macs, Apple’s designs will double or quadruple the number of cores that Intel provides. The current entry-level MacBook Air has two cores, for example.Like Qualcomm Inc. and the rest of the mobile semiconductor industry, Apple designs its smartphone chips with technology from Arm Inc., owned by SoftBank Group Corp. These components often use less energy than Intel’s offerings. But it in recent years, Arm customers have tried to make processors that are also more powerful.The transition to in-house Apple processor designs would likely begin with a new laptop because the company’s first custom Mac chips won’t be able to rival the performance Intel provides for high-end MacBook Pros, iMacs and the Mac Pro desktop computer.The switch away from Intel is complex, requiring close collaboration between Apple’s software, hardware and component-sourcing teams.

In 2018, Apple developed a Mac chip based on the iPad Pro’s A12X processor for internal testing. That gave the company’s engineers confidence they could begin replacing Intel in Macs as early as 2020, Bloomberg News reported.Read more: Apple Said to Work on Mac Chip That Would Lessen Intel RoleApple has already started designing a second generation of Mac processors that follows the architecture of chips planned for the 2021 iPhone. That indicates Apple wants to put its Macs, iPhones and iPads on the same processor development cycle.Despite a unified chip design, Macs will still run the macOS operating system, rather than the iOS software of the iPhone and iPad. Apple is exploring tools that will ensure apps developed for older Intel-based Macs still work on the new machines. The company also has technology called Catalyst that lets software developers build an iPad app and run it on Mac computers.Moving macOS from Intel’s chip architecture to an Arm-based design will be a technical challenge. Microsoft Corp. stumbled with a similar effort.The changes will be a blow to Intel’s prestige. Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs and the late Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini stood on stage in 2005 to announce the first Macs with Intel processors.

      "While some of its mega cap peers have been able to somewhat harness the COVID-19 pandemic to their advantage, the same cannot be said of Apple (APPL). The coronavirus’ effect on the supply chain and attendant macro impact have put a spanner in the works for the tech giant, disrupting laid out plans for 2020.The iPhone 12, Apple’s fanfare launch for 2020 - and first model to boast 5G capabilities - was originally slated for a fall release. But rumors have been circulating that due the pandemic and its impact on consumers’ spending power, the launch will go ahead later than originally expected.Nomura’s Jeff Kvaal believes \"the iPhone 12 is running four to six weeks behind plan.” Kvaal points out that the order changes are part of a wider revised plan for 2H20, which will amount to a “modest reduction in Apple’s build plans through calendar 2020.”The 5-star analyst noted, “The mix is now skewed to the iPhone 11/SE models. Apple’s order reset could also be 1) part of Apple’s commitment to suppliers and 2) concern that the pandemic could mute sales of higher-priced 5G phones. We retain our cautious view of a 5G supercycle. Replacement rates lengthened during the (more clearly beneficial) 4G cycle, and operators are now more targeted in their promotions.”Moreover, Kvaal expects further reductions, considering Apple’s history of cutting orders in phases. The analyst estimates the orders for CY20 will come in at 190 million, compared to the current estimates which suggest orders remains above 200 million.As a result, Kvaal reiterated a Hold rating on Apple shares, along with a $240 price target. The figure implies downside of 14% from current levels. (To watch Kvaal’s track record, click here)The Street, however, remains more upbeat. Apple’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 28 Buys, 6 Holds and 3 Sell ratings. The average price target comes in at $307.91 and could provide returns of 10%, should it be met over the coming months.

      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning to start selling Mac computers with its own main processors by next year, relying on designs that helped popularize the iPhone and iPad, according to people familiar with the matter.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on three of its own Mac processors, known as systems-on-a-chip, based on the A14 processor in the next iPhone. The first of these will be much faster than the processors in the iPhone and iPad, the people said.Apple is preparing to release at least one Mac with its own chip next year, according to the people. But the initiative to develop multiple chips, codenamed Kalamata, suggests the company will transition more of its Mac lineup away from current supplier Intel Corp.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Apple’s partner for iPhone and iPad processors, will build the new Mac chips, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private product plans. The components will be based on a 5-nanometer production technique, the same size Apple will use in the next iPhones and iPad Pros, one of the people said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment, as did Intel and TSMC.Apple is designing more of its own chips to gain greater control over the performance of its devices and differentiate them from rivals. Getting Macs, iPhones and iPads running the same underlying technology should make it easier for Apple to unify its apps ecosystem and update its computers more often. The move would also reduce reliance on Intel, which has struggled to maintain the annual increases in performance it once offered.“This news has negative longer-term implications for Intel, in-line with our concerns around Intel’s future market share,” Brad Gastwirth, chief technology strategist at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note to investors. Shares of the chipmaker fell as much as 2.2% on Thursday while the rest of the market rose.Read more: How Apple Built a Chip Powerhouse to Threaten Qualcomm and IntelCurrent mobile device chips from Apple have multiple processing units, or cores, that handle different types of tasks. The latest iPad Pro has four cores for performance-intensive workloads and another four to handle low-power tasks to preserve battery life.The first Mac processors will have eight high-performance cores, codenamed Firestorm, and at least four energy-efficient cores, known internally as Icestorm. Apple is exploring Mac processors with more than 12 cores for further in the future, the people said.In some Macs, Apple’s designs will double or quadruple the number of cores that Intel provides. The current entry-level MacBook Air has two cores, for example.Like Qualcomm Inc. and the rest of the mobile semiconductor industry, Apple designs its smartphone chips with technology from Arm Inc., owned by SoftBank Group Corp. These components often use less energy than Intel’s offerings. But it in recent years, Arm customers have tried to make processors that are also more powerful.The transition to in-house Apple processor designs would likely begin with a new laptop because the company’s first custom Mac chips won’t be able to rival the performance Intel provides for high-end MacBook Pros, iMacs and the Mac Pro desktop computer.The switch away from Intel is complex, requiring close collaboration between Apple’s software, hardware and component-sourcing teams. Given work-from-home orders and disruptions in the company’s Asia-based supply chain, the shift could be delayed, the people said.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyLike with the iPhone, Apple’s Mac processors will include several components, including the main processor, known as a Central Processing Unit or CPU, and the GPU, the graphics chip. Apple’s lower-end computers currently use Intel for graphics, while it has partnered with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for the graphics cards in its professional-focused offerings.The Kalamata project has been going for several years. In 2018, Apple developed a Mac chip based on the iPad Pro’s A12X processor for internal testing. That gave the company’s engineers confidence they could begin replacing Intel in Macs as early as 2020, Bloomberg News reported.Read more: Apple Said to Work on Mac Chip That Would Lessen Intel RoleApple has already started designing a second generation of Mac processors that follows the architecture of chips planned for the 2021 iPhone. That indicates Apple wants to put its Macs, iPhones and iPads on the same processor development cycle.Despite a unified chip design, Macs will still run the macOS operating system, rather than the iOS software of the iPhone and iPad. Apple is exploring tools that will ensure apps developed for older Intel-based Macs still work on the new machines. The company also has technology called Catalyst that lets software developers build an iPad app and run it on Mac computers.Moving macOS from Intel’s chip architecture to an Arm-based design will be a technical challenge. Microsoft Corp. stumbled with a similar effort.The changes will be a blow to Intel’s prestige. Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs and the late Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini stood on stage in 2005 to announce the first Macs with Intel processors. The decision was praised for several years, resulting in capable computers such as the original Mac Pro in 2006, the second-generation MacBook Air in 2010 and the thinner MacBook Pro in 2012.But in recent years, the pace of Mac upgrades has declined, partly due to a slowdown in Intel’s chip advancements. That sometimes left years between Mac refreshes, upsetting some customers. Intel has also faced manufacturing challenges that Apple has blamed for some recent declines in Mac sales.Read more: Intel’s Chipmaking Throne Is Challenged by Taiwanese UpstartKalamata is Apple’s most ambitious computer chip initiative to date.

      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning to start selling Mac computers with its own main processors by next year, relying on designs that helped popularize the iPhone and iPad, according to people familiar with the matter.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on three of its own Mac processors, known as systems-on-a-chip, based on the A14 processor in the next iPhone. The first of these will be much faster than the processors in the iPhone and iPad, the people said.Apple is preparing to release at least one Mac with its own chip next year, according to the people. But the initiative to develop multiple chips, codenamed Kalamata, suggests the company will transition more of its Mac lineup away from current supplier Intel Corp.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Apple’s partner for iPhone and iPad processors, will build the new Mac chips, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private product plans. The components will be based on a 5-nanometer production technique, the same size Apple will use in the next iPhones and iPad Pros, one of the people said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment, as did Intel and TSMC.Apple is designing more of its own chips to gain greater control over the performance of its devices and differentiate them from rivals. Getting Macs, iPhones and iPads running the same underlying technology should make it easier for Apple to unify its apps ecosystem and update its computers more often. The move would also reduce reliance on Intel, which has struggled to maintain the annual increases in performance it once offered.“This news has negative longer-term implications for Intel, in-line with our concerns around Intel’s future market share,” Brad Gastwirth, chief technology strategist at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note to investors. Shares of the chipmaker fell as much as 2.2% on Thursday while the rest of the market rose.Read more: How Apple Built a Chip Powerhouse to Threaten Qualcomm and IntelCurrent mobile device chips from Apple have multiple processing units, or cores, that handle different types of tasks.

      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning to start selling Mac computers with its own main processors by next year, relying on designs that helped popularize the iPhone and iPad, according to people familiar with the matter.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on three of its own Mac processors, known as systems-on-a-chip, based on the A14 processor in the next iPhone. The first of these will be much faster than the processors in the iPhone and iPad, the people said.Apple is preparing to release at least one Mac with its own chip next year, according to the people. But the initiative to develop multiple chips, codenamed Kalamata, suggests the company will transition more of its Mac lineup away from current supplier Intel Corp.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Apple’s partner for iPhone and iPad processors, will build the new Mac chips, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private product plans. The components will be based on a 5-nanometer production technique, the same size Apple will use in the next iPhones and iPad Pros, one of the people said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment, as did Intel and TSMC.Apple is designing more of its own chips to gain greater control over the performance of its devices and differentiate them from rivals. Getting Macs, iPhones and iPads running the same underlying technology should make it easier for Apple to unify its apps ecosystem and update its computers more often. The move would also reduce reliance on Intel, which has struggled to maintain the annual increases in performance it once offered.“This news has negative longer-term implications for Intel, in-line with our concerns around Intel’s future market share,” Brad Gastwirth, chief technology strategist at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note to investors. Shares of the chipmaker fell as much as 2.2% on Thursday while the rest of the market rose.Read more: How Apple Built a Chip Powerhouse to Threaten Qualcomm and IntelCurrent mobile device chips from Apple have multiple processing units, or cores, that handle different types of tasks. The latest iPad Pro has four cores for performance-intensive workloads and another four to handle low-power tasks to preserve battery life.The first Mac processors will have eight high-performance cores, codenamed Firestorm, and at least four energy-efficient cores, known internally as Icestorm. Apple is exploring Mac processors with more than 12 cores for further in the future, the people said.In some Macs, Apple’s designs will double or quadruple the number of cores that Intel provides. The current entry-level MacBook Air has two cores, for example.Like Qualcomm Inc. and the rest of the mobile semiconductor industry, Apple designs its smartphone chips with technology from Arm Inc., owned by SoftBank Group Corp. These components often use less energy than Intel’s offerings. But it in recent years, Arm customers have tried to make processors that are also more powerful.The transition to in-house Apple processor designs would likely begin with a new laptop because the company’s first custom Mac chips won’t be able to rival the performance Intel provides for high-end MacBook Pros, iMacs and the Mac Pro desktop computer.The switch away from Intel is complex, requiring close collaboration between Apple’s software, hardware and component-sourcing teams. Given work-from-home orders and disruptions in the company’s Asia-based supply chain, the shift could be delayed, the people said.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyLike with the iPhone, Apple’s Mac processors will include several components, including the main processor, known as a Central Processing Unit or CPU, and the GPU, the graphics chip. Apple’s lower-end computers currently use Intel for graphics, while it has partnered with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for the graphics cards in its professional-focused offerings.The Kalamata project has been going for several years. In 2018, Apple developed a Mac chip based on the iPad Pro’s A12X processor for internal testing. That gave the company’s engineers confidence they could begin replacing Intel in Macs as early as 2020, Bloomberg News reported.Read more: Apple Said to Work on Mac Chip That Would Lessen Intel RoleApple has already started designing a second generation of Mac processors that follows the architecture of chips planned for the 2021 iPhone. That indicates Apple wants to put its Macs, iPhones and iPads on the same processor development cycle.Despite a unified chip design, Macs will still run the macOS operating system, rather than the iOS software of the iPhone and iPad. Apple is exploring tools that will ensure apps developed for older Intel-based Macs still work on the new machines. The company also has technology called Catalyst that lets software developers build an iPad app and run it on Mac computers.Moving macOS from Intel’s chip architecture to an Arm-based design will be a technical challenge. Microsoft Corp. stumbled with a similar effort.The changes will be a blow to Intel’s prestige. Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs and the late Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini stood on stage in 2005 to announce the first Macs with Intel processors. The decision was praised for several years, resulting in capable computers such as the original Mac Pro in 2006, the second-generation MacBook Air in 2010 and the thinner MacBook Pro in 2012.But in recent years, the pace of Mac upgrades has declined, partly due to a slowdown in Intel’s chip advancements. That sometimes left years between Mac refreshes, upsetting some customers. Intel has also faced manufacturing challenges that Apple has blamed for some recent declines in Mac sales.Read more: Intel’s Chipmaking Throne Is Challenged by Taiwanese UpstartKalamata is Apple’s most ambitious computer chip initiative to date. It currently offers specific chips for Mac features, such as security and power management, that work alongside the main Intel processors.Apple also aims to stop using Intel cellular modems -- chips that connect smartphones to the internet and support calls -- after using them for only four years. The company plans to use 5G modems from Qualcomm in as many as four new iPhone models later this year.

Apple’s order reset could also be 1) part of Apple’s commitment to suppliers and 2) concern that the pandemic could mute sales of higher-priced 5G phones. We retain our cautious view of a 5G supercycle. Replacement rates lengthened during the (more clearly beneficial) 4G cycle, and operators are now more targeted in their promotions.”Moreover, Kvaal expects further reductions, considering Apple’s history of cutting orders in phases. The analyst estimates the orders for CY20 will come in at 190 million, compared to the current estimates which suggest orders remains above 200 million.As a result, Kvaal reiterated a Hold rating on Apple shares, along with a $240 price target. The figure implies downside of 14% from current levels. (To watch Kvaal’s track record, click here)The Street, however, remains more upbeat. Apple’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 28 Buys, 6 Holds and 3 Sell ratings.

      "While Wedbush sees a difficult short-term trajectory for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), the sell-side firm said Thursday that Cupertino is staying on track with the launch schedule for its flagship product, the iPhone.  The Apple Analyst Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating on Apple with a $335 price target. What's Known About The iPhone 12 Apple is likely working on four iPhone 12 models,  with a mix of 4G and 5G phones that are likely to be launched between October and early December, just in time for the holiday season, Ives said in a Thursday note, citing supply chain checks in Asia. (See his track record here.)The analyst said he expects two versions of 5G phones, U.S. and non-U.S., with the U.S. version likely to have mmWave technology that could push out the production timeline.Many units could therefore be shifted to the March quarter, he said. Muted Expectations For Apple's Q2 Apple, which is scheduled to report its second-quarter results April 30 after the market closes, could report a dismal quarter and provide a bleak outlook for the June quarter amid COVID-19 pandemic-induced softness, Ives said.The analyst said the near-term demand picture around the world remains \"ominous\" due to the pandemic.  2021 Looks Promising For Apple, Wedbush Says Ives is optimistic concerning calendar year 2021.\"Now with the bad news out of the way, which we believe the Street will largely look through in terms of the stock, all the focus now shifts to iPhone 12, 5G, and the unit trajectory for September and heading into 1HFY21,\" the analyst said. Unit shipments of the iPhone could be around 165 million to 185 million in 2020, he said, citing Asia checks and supply chain contacts.Apple possesses strong underlying momentum into 2021 thanks to the imminent launch of the iPhone 12, according to Wedbush.

      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning to start selling Mac computers with its own main processors by next year, relying on designs that helped popularize the iPhone and iPad, according to people familiar with the matter.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on three of its own Mac processors, known as systems-on-a-chip, based on the A14 processor in the next iPhone. The first of these will be much faster than the processors in the iPhone and iPad, the people said.Apple is preparing to release at least one Mac with its own chip next year, according to the people. But the initiative to develop multiple chips, codenamed Kalamata, suggests the company will transition more of its Mac lineup away from current supplier Intel Corp.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Apple’s partner for iPhone and iPad processors, will build the new Mac chips, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private product plans. The components will be based on a 5-nanometer production technique, the same size Apple will use in the next iPhones and iPad Pros, one of the people said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment, as did Intel and TSMC.Apple is designing more of its own chips to gain greater control over the performance of its devices and differentiate them from rivals. Getting Macs, iPhones and iPads running the same underlying technology should make it easier for Apple to unify its apps ecosystem and update its computers more often. The move would also reduce reliance on Intel, which has struggled to maintain the annual increases in performance it once offered.“This news has negative longer-term implications for Intel, in-line with our concerns around Intel’s future market share,” Brad Gastwirth, chief technology strategist at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note to investors. Shares of the chipmaker fell as much as 2.2% on Thursday while the rest of the market rose.Read more: How Apple Built a Chip Powerhouse to Threaten Qualcomm and IntelCurrent mobile device chips from Apple have multiple processing units, or cores, that handle different types of tasks. The latest iPad Pro has four cores for performance-intensive workloads and another four to handle low-power tasks to preserve battery life.The first Mac processors will have eight high-performance cores, codenamed Firestorm, and at least four energy-efficient cores, known internally as Icestorm. Apple is exploring Mac processors with more than 12 cores for further in the future, the people said.In some Macs, Apple’s designs will double or quadruple the number of cores that Intel provides. The current entry-level MacBook Air has two cores, for example.Like Qualcomm Inc. and the rest of the mobile semiconductor industry, Apple designs its smartphone chips with technology from Arm Inc., owned by SoftBank Group Corp. These components often use less energy than Intel’s offerings. But it in recent years, Arm customers have tried to make processors that are also more powerful.The transition to in-house Apple processor designs would likely begin with a new laptop because the company’s first custom Mac chips won’t be able to rival the performance Intel provides for high-end MacBook Pros, iMacs and the Mac Pro desktop computer.The switch away from Intel is complex, requiring close collaboration between Apple’s software, hardware and component-sourcing teams. Given work-from-home orders and disruptions in the company’s Asia-based supply chain, the shift could be delayed, the people said.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyLike with the iPhone, Apple’s Mac processors will include several components, including the main processor, known as a Central Processing Unit or CPU, and the GPU, the graphics chip. Apple’s lower-end computers currently use Intel for graphics, while it has partnered with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for the graphics cards in its professional-focused offerings.The Kalamata project has been going for several years. In 2018, Apple developed a Mac chip based on the iPad Pro’s A12X processor for internal testing. That gave the company’s engineers confidence they could begin replacing Intel in Macs as early as 2020, Bloomberg News reported.Read more: Apple Said to Work on Mac Chip That Would Lessen Intel RoleApple has already started designing a second generation of Mac processors that follows the architecture of chips planned for the 2021 iPhone. That indicates Apple wants to put its Macs, iPhones and iPads on the same processor development cycle.Despite a unified chip design, Macs will still run the macOS operating system, rather than the iOS software of the iPhone and iPad. Apple is exploring tools that will ensure apps developed for older Intel-based Macs still work on the new machines. The company also has technology called Catalyst that lets software developers build an iPad app and run it on Mac computers.Moving macOS from Intel’s chip architecture to an Arm-based design will be a technical challenge. Microsoft Corp. stumbled with a similar effort.The changes will be a blow to Intel’s prestige. Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs and the late Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini stood on stage in 2005 to announce the first Macs with Intel processors. The decision was praised for several years, resulting in capable computers such as the original Mac Pro in 2006, the second-generation MacBook Air in 2010 and the thinner MacBook Pro in 2012.But in recent years, the pace of Mac upgrades has declined, partly due to a slowdown in Intel’s chip advancements.

      "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning to start selling Mac computers with its own main processors by next year, relying on designs that helped popularize the iPhone and iPad, according to people familiar with the matter.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on three of its own Mac processors, known as systems-on-a-chip, based on the A14 processor in the next iPhone. The first of these will be much faster than the processors in the iPhone and iPad, the people said.Apple is preparing to release at least one Mac with its own chip next year, according to the people. But the initiative to develop multiple chips, codenamed Kalamata, suggests the company will transition more of its Mac lineup away from current supplier Intel Corp.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Apple’s partner for iPhone and iPad processors, will build the new Mac chips, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private product plans. The components will be based on a 5-nanometer production technique, the same size Apple will use in the next iPhones and iPad Pros, one of the people said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment, as did Intel and TSMC.Apple is designing more of its own chips to gain greater control over the performance of its devices and differentiate them from rivals. Getting Macs, iPhones and iPads running the same underlying technology should make it easier for Apple to unify its apps ecosystem and update its computers more often. The move would also reduce reliance on Intel, which has struggled to maintain the annual increases in performance it once offered.“This news has negative longer-term implications for Intel, in-line with our concerns around Intel’s future market share,” Brad Gastwirth, chief technology strategist at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note to investors. Shares of the chipmaker fell as much as 2.2% on Thursday while the rest of the market rose.Read more: How Apple Built a Chip Powerhouse to Threaten Qualcomm and IntelCurrent mobile device chips from Apple have multiple processing units, or cores, that handle different types of tasks. The latest iPad Pro has four cores for performance-intensive workloads and another four to handle low-power tasks to preserve battery life.The first Mac processors will have eight high-performance cores, codenamed Firestorm, and at least four energy-efficient cores, known internally as Icestorm. Apple is exploring Mac processors with more than 12 cores for further in the future, the people said.In some Macs, Apple’s designs will double or quadruple the number of cores that Intel provides. The current entry-level MacBook Air has two cores, for example.Like Qualcomm Inc. and the rest of the mobile semiconductor industry, Apple designs its smartphone chips with technology from Arm Inc., owned by SoftBank Group Corp. These components often use less energy than Intel’s offerings. But it in recent years, Arm customers have tried to make processors that are also more powerful.The transition to in-house Apple processor designs would likely begin with a new laptop because the company’s first custom Mac chips won’t be able to rival the performance Intel provides for high-end MacBook Pros, iMacs and the Mac Pro desktop computer.The switch away from Intel is complex, requiring close collaboration between Apple’s software, hardware and component-sourcing teams. Given work-from-home orders and disruptions in the company’s Asia-based supply chain, the shift could be delayed, the people said.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyLike with the iPhone, Apple’s Mac processors will include several components, including the main processor, known as a Central Processing Unit or CPU, and the GPU, the graphics chip. Apple’s lower-end computers currently use Intel for graphics, while it has partnered with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for the graphics cards in its professional-focused offerings.The Kalamata project has been going for several years. In 2018, Apple developed a Mac chip based on the iPad Pro’s A12X processor for internal testing. That gave the company’s engineers confidence they could begin replacing Intel in Macs as early as 2020, Bloomberg News reported.Read more: Apple Said to Work on Mac Chip That Would Lessen Intel RoleApple has already started designing a second generation of Mac processors that follows the architecture of chips planned for the 2021 iPhone. That indicates Apple wants to put its Macs, iPhones and iPads on the same processor development cycle.Despite a unified chip design, Macs will still run the macOS operating system, rather than the iOS software of the iPhone and iPad. Apple is exploring tools that will ensure apps developed for older Intel-based Macs still work on the new machines. The company also has technology called Catalyst that lets software developers build an iPad app and run it on Mac computers.Moving macOS from Intel’s chip architecture to an Arm-based design will be a technical challenge. Microsoft Corp. stumbled with a similar effort.The changes will be a blow to Intel’s prestige. Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs and the late Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini stood on stage in 2005 to announce the first Macs with Intel processors. The decision was praised for several years, resulting in capable computers such as the original Mac Pro in 2006, the second-generation MacBook Air in 2010 and the thinner MacBook Pro in 2012.But in recent years, the pace of Mac upgrades has declined, partly due to a slowdown in Intel’s chip advancements.

The current entry-level MacBook Air has two cores, for example.Like Qualcomm Inc. and the rest of the mobile semiconductor industry, Apple designs its smartphone chips with technology from Arm Inc., owned by SoftBank Group Corp. These components often use less energy than Intel’s offerings.

      "While some of its mega cap peers have been able to somewhat harness the COVID-19 pandemic to their advantage, the same cannot be said of Apple (APPL). The coronavirus’ effect on the supply chain and attendant macro impact have put a spanner in the works for the tech giant, disrupting laid out plans for 2020.The iPhone 12, Apple’s fanfare launch for 2020 - and first model to boast 5G capabilities - was originally slated for a fall release. But rumors have been circulating that due the pandemic and its impact on consumers’ spending power, the launch will go ahead later than originally expected.Nomura’s Jeff Kvaal believes \"the iPhone 12 is running four to six weeks behind plan.” Kvaal points out that the order changes are part of a wider revised plan for 2H20, which will amount to a “modest reduction in Apple’s build plans through calendar 2020.”The 5-star analyst noted, “The mix is now skewed to the iPhone 11/SE models. Apple’s order reset could also be 1) part of Apple’s commitment to suppliers and 2) concern that the pandemic could mute sales of higher-priced 5G phones. We retain our cautious view of a 5G supercycle. Replacement rates lengthened during the (more clearly beneficial) 4G cycle, and operators are now more targeted in their promotions.”Moreover, Kvaal expects further reductions, considering Apple’s history of cutting orders in phases. The analyst estimates the orders for CY20 will come in at 190 million, compared to the current estimates which suggest orders remains above 200 million.As a result, Kvaal reiterated a Hold rating on Apple shares, along with a $240 price target. The figure implies downside of 14% from current levels. (To watch Kvaal’s track record, click here)The Street, however, remains more upbeat. Apple’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 28 Buys, 6 Holds and 3 Sell ratings. The average price target comes in at $307.91 and could provide returns of 10%, should it be met over the coming months.

The coronavirus’ effect on the supply chain and attendant macro impact have put a spanner in the works for the tech giant, disrupting laid out plans for 2020.The iPhone 12, Apple’s fanfare launch for 2020 - and first model to boast 5G capabilities - was originally slated for a fall release. But rumors have been circulating that due the pandemic and its impact on consumers’ spending power, the launch will go ahead later than originally expected.Nomura’s Jeff Kvaal believes \"the iPhone 12 is running four to six weeks behind plan.” Kvaal points out that the order changes are part of a wider revised plan for 2H20, which will amount to a “modest reduction in Apple’s build plans through calendar 2020.”The 5-star analyst noted, “The mix is now skewed to the iPhone 11/SE models. Apple’s order reset could also be 1) part of Apple’s commitment to suppliers and 2) concern that the pandemic could mute sales of higher-priced 5G phones. We retain our cautious view of a 5G supercycle. Replacement rates lengthened during the (more clearly beneficial) 4G cycle, and operators are now more targeted in their promotions.”Moreover, Kvaal expects further reductions, considering Apple’s history of cutting orders in phases. The analyst estimates the orders for CY20 will come in at 190 million, compared to the current estimates which suggest orders remains above 200 million.As a result, Kvaal reiterated a Hold rating on Apple shares, along with a $240 price target. The figure implies downside of 14% from current levels. (To watch Kvaal’s track record, click here)The Street, however, remains more upbeat. Apple’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 28 Buys, 6 Holds and 3 Sell ratings. The average price target comes in at $307.91 and could provide returns of 10%, should it be met over the coming months.
