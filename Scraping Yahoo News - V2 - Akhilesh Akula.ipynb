      "Apple’s iPhones are some of the world’s most popular smartphones. But consumers on a budget have had to opt for older, more affordable models, rather than the latest and greatest devices. And that’s where the company’s new iPhone SE comes in.The follow-up to 2016’s iPhone SE, the new edition starts at just $399, packing all of the processing power of Apple’s (AAPL) current iPhone 11 line into what is essentially the body of 2017’s $449 iPhone 8. That means you get a 4.7-inch display, something fans of smaller phones have been clamoring for, as well as the classic Home button and Touch ID sensor, also fan favorites.What you don’t get, however, is the multi-camera layout of the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, or those phones’ edge-to-edge displays.But for a device with a rock-bottom starting price, and easy entry into Apple’s broader ecosystem, the iPhone SE is a stellar value.Apple’s iPhone 8 lived on through the company’s stores for quite some time. In fact, the tech giant lowered the phone’s price to $449 as recently as September when it launched the iPhone 11 line, which starts at $699 with the iPhone 11 and tops out at around $1,000 for the iPhone 11 Pro. All of that is to say the iPhone SE should be a familiar face.That’s because it quite literally has the same design as the standard version of the iPhone 8. Heck, the phones share the exact same weight and dimensions. I’ve been using an iPhone 11 Pro Max, Apple’s largest phone, and it makes the iPhone SE feel incredibly small and light by comparison.If you’ve been using an older iPhone, such as the iPhone 8 or even the iPhone 7 or iPhone 6, moving to the SE will feel like a natural transition. There are no new features to learn like Face ID, the SE comes with Apple’s popular Touch ID fingerprint reader, and the interface is more or less the same as what you’d find on older iPhones rather than the swipe-heavy interface found on newer devices.Like the iPhone 8, the iPhone SE offers IP67 dust and water resistance, which means the phone can take a dip in up to 3 feet of water for as long as 30 minutes before it gives up the ghost. Apple’s new devices, including the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, can survive falling into water as deep 6.4 feet and 13 feet, respectively.The iPhone SE marks the return of Apple’s small-screen form factor. Unlike the company’s iPhone 11, which sports a sizable 6.1-inch display, or the Pro models, which pack 5.8-inch and 6.5-inch screens, respectively, the iPhone SE has a modest 4.7-inch panel. That screen is essentially the same Retina Display panel found on the iPhone 8, and features Apple’s True Tone technology, which automatically adjusts the color temperature of the screen to match the ambient lighting, ensuring the panel never looks too blue or yellow.The SE also includes two large bezels above and below its display. It would be great if the SE packed an edge-to-edge panel, but doing so would likely drive its price up significantly. That said, the SE’s screen doesn’t feel too cramped when typing or watching shows, something I spent a good deal doing when I was supposed to be working.Unlike the iPhone 11, which has a dual-camera setup, or the iPhone 11 Pro, which packs three cameras, the iPhone SE has a single-lens camera. But it’s one heck of a camera. I took the SE and the $1,099 11 Pro Max out on a walk to my local park, to see how well the least expensive iPhone’s camera stood up to the most expensive iPhone’s camera, and outside of low-light photos, the two were on a par with each other.Photos of a flowering Kanzan Cherry Tree looked brilliant when taken with both the SE and 11 Pro. The tree’s bronze leaves and pink flowers offered a distinctive contrast in both shots, without any over saturation.The SE’s lone issue is its low-light capabilities. To be fair to Apple, the company doesn’t include its low-light photo mode with the SE. That is found on the iPhone 11 line, and truly offers a dramatic improvement when capturing photos in poorly lit settings. The SE struggles compared to the 11 Pro Max, but that’s to be expected when there’s no specific night mode.Impressively, Apple included its Portrait mode with the SE’s FaceTime camera. Portrait mode creates a bokeh effect that sharpens your subject in the foreground, while blurring the background.I’ve cultivated a sizable amount of facial hair during my time in lockdown, and figured the camera would have issues discerning my beard from the tree behind me — but it managed to do so without issue multiple times.Where the iPhone SE really distinguishes itself from the iPhone 8 is in the performance department. Unlike the iPhone 8, which came with Apple’s A11 processor, the iPhone SE gets Apple’s top-of-the-line A13 Bionic chip. That’s the same processor found in the iPhone 11 line.As a result, the SE handled every app I threw at it without issue. Apple Arcade games like “Sneaky Sasquatch” ran as smoothly on the SE as they do on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. The A13 Bionic chip also means the SE can handle things like machine learning and augmented reality, two functions Apple has been keen on pushing forward.Battery life for the SE is, according to Apple, roughly the same as the iPhone 8. I gave the SE’s battery a serious test by using it to broadcast live video from my home for Yahoo Finance’s slate of daily shows for two straight hours. About 20 minutes before the end of the broadcast, I received an alert saying the battery was down to 20%.I usually use the 11 Pro Max to do the same kind of broadcasting and end with about 40% battery life, but still manage to get through most of the rest of the day without having to recharge.All of that is to say that the SE will provide enough power to deal with your average user’s needs, but might come up a little short under extreme circumstances. I don’t imagine most people will be broadcasting live video for two hours from their phone everyday, though.The iPhone SE is a powerful smartphone in a compact, inexpensive package. For the person moving up from an iPhone 6, iPhone 7, or iPhone 8 who doesn’t want to spend a lot of cash, it’s a perfect fit. If you want the kind of showstopping features found in the iPhone 11 Pro, like FaceID and multiple cameras, you’ll have to look elsewhere.This is a phone that will ensure users looking at a low-cost option get into Apple’s ecosystem at a bargain of a price. Remember, every new iPhone means the potential for sales of Apple accessories and services.The SE is also a perfect product for one of the fastest growing smartphone markets: India. The iPhone 11 is largely too expensive for consumers in that country, but the SE could be a perfect fit.The iPhone SE looks poised to be a winner for Apple no matter how you slice it.More from Dan:Got a tip?

      "Unemployment continues to rise in the U.S. amid a government-mandated shutdown of the economy. Initial jobless claims for the week came in at 4.4 million Thursday, pushing the total above 26 million and producing an estimated 15% unemployment rate.The question I’m being asked most is: “Who is buying this stock market?” Many investors believe the stock market has gone bonkers, saying it has become totally divorced from the reality on Main Street. I agree that the stock market isn’t reflecting the economy. There are many reasons for it, and the details will be the subject of a future column.

The chart shows that, until last week, about 65% of the rise in the stock market was short-squeeze-related. There are several elements to this increase that all investors should become familiar with. These elements are described in detail in “The force that’s propelled the stock market rally will exhaust itself this week.”3. Start out with the premise that even if unemployment reaches 20%, then 80% of the people are still employed.4. A majority of the people who are losing their jobs earn less than average and work in service sectors. They typically do not invest in the stock market, as they generally do not have the resources to invest. 5. People who generally invest in the stock market still have their jobs. They are still contributing to their 401(k)s, which is creating buying. 6. The chart shows a sharp drop that touched the upper band of the “mother of support zones” and a quick rebound to the bottom band of the resistance zone. History tells us that quick market moves do not change the behavior of investors, money managers and institutions alike.7. History tells us that it takes prolonged pain to change human behavior. In the coronavirus crisis, the pain has not been prolonged for stock market investors.8. There is considerable anecdotal evidence that prudent investors have become very cautious, but they represent only a small part of the total. 9. Some prudent investors including money managers often have no choice but to hold their nose and buy stocks in a rising market. Many money managers are expected to beat their benchmark indexes. For them, falling too far behind is career suicide. 10. Many investors feel they have legitimate reasons to buy — monetary stimulus, fiscal stimulus, pent-up demand and a potential cure and vaccine for the coronavirus. 11.

      "Despite Apple  (AAPL) - Get Report recently unveiling a refresh of the budget iPhone SE, there’s some pessimism on Wall Street about the number of iPhones the tech giant will ship this year, with estimates having been steadily declining since the end of February. Some negative headlines haven’t helped, such as the Financial Times' recent report that Foxconn, a division of Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry and the firm charged with assembling the vast majority of iPhones, has stopped hiring at its plants in China that make the phone and has cut back on part-time workers’ hours.Apple seems confident: it has told suppliers to plan for a 4% increase in production of the device through the next 12 months, potentially to make sure it has no shortages during its all-important holiday season.And there could in fact be room for upside. Even in a lockdown situation, people still need to upgrade the device that has largely become many people’s only computer, the mobile phone.But the bar is set low for Apple. iPhone sales dropped 14%, year over year, to $142.4 billion in the September-ending fiscal 2019. Analysts estimate that iPhone unit sales dropped by the same percentage, to 188 million units. (Apple at the end of 2018 stopped disclosing unit shipments of iPhone on a quarterly basis, but Wall Street still makes forecasts.)For fiscal 2020, analysts project an increase of 3.3% in units shipped, to 194 million, with a fairly wide range, from 175 million to 212 million, according to FactSet.iPhone dollar sales may be roughly flat with last year, $142.09 billion, given that analysts expect average selling prices to drop by 2% to $740. What could produce upside? Simply the need to upgrade one's primary computing device now that it has become even more the center of existence, including now socializing. It’s unlikely most people who have become accustomed to relying on a phone will suddenly become laptop users.Assuming the phone remains the primary digital device, it has to be upgraded at some point. One of two things are likely to happen. Either people will resign themselves to living in some form of quarantine for a while longer, perhaps until a vaccine is invented, or some positive turn in COVID-19 data points will help open up society and people will be back on the streets.Assuming September is still the time frame for a new “flagship” iPhone debut, that time is still some months off. A lot could change in that time to open up society. That might put people back in a buying modem with newfound mobility translating into the need for a  new phone.But assuming the worst-case scenario -- that people have to hunker down for a lot longer -- the imperative to keep up in a world where socializing is more digital than ever means people have to increase the speed of their devices to keep up with all the digital activities that now dominate their lives. A new “digital divide” is taking shape in quarantine between those who have adequate computing resources, and those who don't.Consider the Zoom  (ZM) - Get Report application, which has become the way to experience cocktail hours and birthdays and so much more. Anyone who’s been on these calls has observed that half the people on the call are using a smartphone instead of a laptop. And the experience of those people on a smartphone appears to be quite dreadful, with aging iPhones freezing in mid-video.Of course, in unprecedented times, Apple could take extraordinary steps. With cash and equivalents of $207 billion, according to its most recent 10-Q, and with public opinion currently against share repurchases, Apple could enhance its existing financing program for purchases with more generous terms that would allow more customers to effectively buy on credit. Don’t rule out such largesse as a clever tactic by Cook & Co. to goose sales if they feel it would cheer their customer base.  Some pessimism is reasonable about iPhone, in the face of a potential global recession, if not an outright depression. But it’s also possible the iPhone, as the lifeline in good times and bad, can surprise as people realize it’s almost as essential as toilet paper.Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer’s Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

      "(Repeats April 24 story with no changes to text)By Stephen Nellis and Paresh DaveSAN FRANCISCO, April 24 (Reuters) - U.S. states promoting apps that could prove essential to ending the coronavirus lockdown may be headed for a showdown with the two Silicon Valley companies that control key software on 99% of smartphones over the collection of sensitive GPS location data.Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google plan to release technology jointly in the coming weeks for digital contact tracing through Bluetooth sensors on phones. Public health authorities have determined that the technology is crucial to apps that will alert people when they have been close to people who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus.For contact tracing apps to work, however, millions of people must be willing to use them without fear their locations and other personal data is being tracked and stored.Google and Apple have sought to build public trust by emphasizing that the changes they are making to Bluetooth to allow the tracing apps to work will not tap phones' GPS sensors, which privacy activists see as too intrusive.But the states pioneering the apps - North and South Dakota, and Utah - say allowing public health authorities to use GPS in tandem with Bluetooth is key to making the system viable.The Bluetooth technology will enable users to be notified if they crossed paths with a coronavirus carrier, but will not specify where the encounter happened, information crucial to authorities who want to identify hotspots for virus transmission and move fast to stop outbreaks.Apple and Google said on Friday that they still have not decided how to proceed.\"I would encourage them to go for the 'and' and not the 'or' solution,\" North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum said of Apple and Google in an interview late Thursday.\"During this new normal, there is a place for having solutions that protect privacy and enable more efficient contact tracing,\" said Burgum, himself a former software executive who sold a company to Microsoft Corp for more than $1 billion in 2001.APPS AT WORKAnonymized GPS location data is already playing a key role in an early version of Care19, an app that about 40,000 people have signed up for in North and South Dakota.Authorities currently ask Care19 users to give them permission for timestamped GPS location data, which allows officials to manually call places where users could have spread the virus and ask for names and numbers of others who may have been there at the same time.This laborious process will no longer be necessary with the Bluetooth technology coming from Apple and Google, which will automatically catalog encounters between users and enable carriers to anonymously convey to others potentially infected that they should get tested. Without the changes the two companies are working on, iPhone users would have to keep their phone unlocked and app open at all times.Utah’s Healthy Together contact tracing app, which launched on Wednesday, for now is using a workaround that only catalogs some encounters. Healthy Together also collects location data and its developers hope Apple and Google do not force them to drop that functionality to adopt the more comprehensive Bluetooth technology.\"What Utah wanted to understand is not just who is spreading [the virus] to whom but also location zones,\" said Jared Allgood, chief strategy officer for Twenty, the startup which developed Utah’s app for an initial $1.75 million.GPS location data allows authorities to decide which businesses may need to be closed because the virus is spreading there, and prioritize which contacts of diagnosed patients to test.\"Is it happening in a park, a Costco or a Walmart? They are trying to make policy decisions that move our economy from a broad-based 'everything is shut down' to a more targeted approach,\" Allgood said in an interview on Friday.Privacy experts have warned that any cache of location data related to health issues could make businesses and individuals vulnerable to being ostracized if the data are exposed.But Tim Brookins, a principal engineer at Microsoft who previously worked for Burgum and developed Care19 independently of his employer, said location data is stored on a Microsoft Azure server that he rents and to which only he and one other person have the keys. North Dakota is paying about $9,000 to license Care19 for six months, he said.Allgood said the Utah app asks users for their phone number, but location data is stored anonymously in a server rented from Amazon Web Services.\"We don’t see a reason why Apple or Google would not allow us to participate in their tools,\" said Diesel Peltz, Twenty’s CEO.Brookins and Burgum expressed confidence the two tech giants would allow for location data collection after seeing the safeguards Care19 has put in place, including not asking for users' names, phone numbers or email addresses.\"Some people are completely opposed to an intrusion on privacy but there's a younger generation sharing their location on dozens of apps,\" Burgum said.\"There may be a set of people highly social, young and going out to bars who may see this tool as fantastic.\" (Reporting by Paresh Dave and Stephen Nellis Editing by Sonya Hepinstall)\n",

      "There’s a lot up in the air right now for Apple (AAPL), argues Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. The analyst foresees some dark days ahead for the tech giant before emerging on the other side.After speaking to supply chain contacts in Asia, it appears demand for iPhones has deteriorated by a further 15% when comparing current shipment numbers to the original expectations. In the current uncertain economic environment, this is hardly surprising.“These data points are generally in line with our initial stress test model which significantly reduced our March/June iPhone units to reflect this near-term economic abyss,” Ives said.Looking ahead to next week’s earnings report, Ives sets an ominous tone and believes the Street is prepared for a “Friday the 13th-like March quarter and June guidance.” Ives points out, bluntly, that “global lockdown has put health, jobs, groceries, and hand sanitizer well above buying a $1,000+ iPhone 11 on the consumer priority list in this environment.”However, with the bad news out of the way, Ives believes investors will look through the macro challenges and focus on the upcoming iPhone 12 cycle. The problem right now is that all dates concerning the launch remain speculative as no timetable has been announced. The Street will be looking for clarity from Apple CEO Tim Cook, regarding this issue, in next week’s earnings call.Ives believes the launch will be pushed back to the holiday season in order to ensure a smooth lift off for Apple’s leading product. The analyst points out that the logistics and planning that go into coordinating the release, “make the original Fall timeframe a very difficult one to hit.” Yet, despite the present uncertainty, Ives believes Apple has what it takes to weather the storm.Ives concluded, “Our Asia checks and supply chain contacts are now looking at iPhone units in the 165 million to 185 million range for CY20 with strong underlying momentum into CY21 on the heels of iPhone 12… In sum, it will be some dark days ahead for Cook & Co given this unprecedented COVID-19 environment, however on the other side of the valley the pieces are in place for a robust product cycle into FY21 with a more normalized macro backdrop.”The 5-star analyst keeps an Outperform rating on Apple shares, along with a $335 price target, which implies about 18% upside from Friday's closing price. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)TipRanks shows a large amount of bulls liking the odds here. Out of 35 analysts tracked in the last 3 months, 27 are bullish on Apple stock, 6 are playing it safe on the sidelines, while just 2 are running for the hills. Meanwhile, the 12-month average price target of $310.23 suggests a nearly 10% upside potential from where the stock is currently trading. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks)To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.\n",
      "Amazon AMZN shares have surged over 42% since March 16, as investors clamor for stocks that seem immune to the coronavirus economic downturn. And with a business based on e-commerce and cloud computing, the Seattle powerhouse does seem tailor-made to outperform during these uncertain times.With this in mind, let’s dive into what to expect from Amazon’s Q1 fiscal 2020 earnings results that are due out on Thursday, April 30.Quick Earnings Outlook  Our most recent Zacks estimates, from Friday, April 24 project that overall earnings for the S&P 500 will sink -15.3% on +1.2% higher revenues in the first quarter. The outlook appears even worse in the second quarter, with earnings expected to tumble -31.5% (also read: Previewing Tech Sector Earnings).That said, energy, transportation, autos, consumer discretionary, and other sectors are projected to take huge hits. Meanwhile, tech sector S&P 500 earnings are only expected to dip -0.7% in the first quarter.This could be part of the reason that Amazon and other tech giants such as Microsoft MSFT have outperformed the market recently, and helped drive the comeback from the March 23 lows.Amazon’s PitchDespite signs that social distancing and stay-at-home measures are working, and that governments around the world are starting to figure out how to start reopening parts of their economies, people are likely to remain largely inside. This means that Amazon’s e-commerce delivery business is likely to grow even more than it has been.Back in March, the company announced plans to hire an additional 100,000 employees in the U.S. to deal with increased demand—which is striking as millions of Americans file for unemployment benefits. Amazon’s ability to effectively meet consumer demand during these tough times could help it separate itself from retail rivals Walmart WMT, Target TGT, and others, who have all ramped out their own e-commerce and delivery offerings.        Amazon’s pitch to investors for years has been that it operates a business built for the future, and this has become crystal clear during the coronavirus pandemic.   For instance, Amazon’s core e-commerce business, which includes online store sales and its third-party seller services, accounted for around 72% for total fourth quarter 2019 revenue. Its Prime-heavy subscription revenue accounted for roughly 6% of quarterly sales, while its AWS cloud computing business made up nearly 12%.Amazon’s fastest-growing segment in Q4 was its digital advertising-heavy “Other” unit. This division jumped 41% as it competes against Google GOOGL and Facebook FB. And let’s not forget that it competes alongside Netflix NFLX, Disney DIS, Apple AAPL, and others in the streaming TV market.Outlook Amazon’s Q1 fiscal 2020 revenue is projected to jump 23% from the year-ago period to $73.42 billion, based on our latest Zacks estimates. This would top Q4’s 21% top-line expansion. Peeking ahead, AMZN’s full-year fiscal 2020 sales are expected to jump over 20% to come in at $337.56 billion.The company’s 2021 revenue is then projected to climb another 17.5% to hit $396.42 billion. These estimates are both up over the last month and compare favorably to 2019’s 20% sales expansion. And sometimes the percentage climbs don’t do Amazon justice. For example, AMZN revenue is projected to grow by $60 billion in 2021—Facebook made $70 in all of 2018.At the bottom end of the income statement, Amazon’s Q1 earnings are expected to slip 11% to $6.31 a share. It is worth noting that AMZN’s earnings took a hit last year as it ramped up spending to reduce Prime shipping to one-day, down from two. And clearly Amazon’s costs appear to be on the rise as it hires more employees and deals with higher volumes.Still, AMZN’s adjusted fiscal 2020 EPS figure is projected to jump 20.8%, with FY21 set to surge 46.3% above our current year estimate.Bottom LineAmazon’s earnings revisions have trended in the wrong direction recently, which helps it hold a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. Yet, AMZN shares have surged over 30% in 2020, against the S&P 500’s 13% decline. The chart above also shows that the Amazon stock began to break out after March 16.This means that the coronavirus economic shutdown spurred Amazon stock to new highs, as investors searched for safe-havens. That said, some investors might want to wait to see how AMZN’s report and guidance shake out, amid a big week for Wall Street and tech powers.But longer-term investors might want to consider buying Amazon because its current price could look like a steal six months or a year from now, even if it falls in the near-term.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

      "(Updates with close of U.S. market)By David Randall and David HenryNEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - Global equity benchmarks struggled on Friday as some U.S. states began reopening businesses despite the disapproval of health experts, and as the European Union put off addressing details of its new economic rescue plan.Safe-haven government bonds edged up while the dollar slipped, reflecting the market's unsettled direction. Oil's recovery lost some steam during the day.MSCI's All Country World Index rose 0.45% as losses in Europe weighed on U.S. equity gains. The index is on pace for its worst weekly performance since March.Investors are watching for health data from early-opening states to learn if they acted too quickly, said Stan Shipley, macro research analyst for Evercore ISI.\"The market is kind of stuck here,\" Shipley said. \"I don't think it will move far from here until we see that we can reopen the economy.\"As the U.S. coronavirus death toll topped 50,000, Georgia pushed ahead with its plan to become the first state to allow an array of small businesses to reopen on Friday despite the disapproval of President Donald Trump and health experts.On Wall Street, stocks got an afternoon lift from big market-cap techs Microsoft and Apple, which rose as much as 1.3% and 2.6%, respectively.The S&P 500 gained 38.94 points, or 1.39%, to 2,836.74 and the Nasdaq Composite added 139.77 points, or 1.65%, to 8,634.52.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 260.01 points, or 1.11%, to 23,775.27, despite Boeing Co falling more than 5% on a report the planemaker was planning to cut 787 Dreamliner output by about half.The S&P ended the week down 12.2 percent for the year after having recovered half of what it lost from its Feb. 19 high to its March 23 low.EU leaders agreed on Thursday to build a trillion-euro emergency fund to help recover from the coronavirus outbreak, while leaving divisive details until the summer.French President Emmanuel Macron said differences continued between EU governments over whether the fund should be transferring grant money, or simply making loans.\"The risk exists that a concrete decision on the creation of the recovery fund may not occur before September, thereby not being operational before early 2021,\" Goldman Sachs European economist Alain Durre wrote in a note.The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.10%.Investors remained in perceived safe-haven government bonds. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 0.5914%, from 0.611% on Thursday.The dollar index fell 0.269%, but the euro rose 0.34% to $1.0813.The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday passed a $484 billion bill to expand federal loans to small businesses and hospitals overwhelmed by patients.Trump, who signed the bill into law on Friday, said late Thursday he may need to extend social distancing guidelines to early summer.Oil prices lost momentum during the day but broadly retained their recovery from this week's price collapse, which pushed U.S. crude futures into negative territory for the first time ever. Prices were supported by producers such as Kuwait saying they would move to cut output.U.S. crude, which had been up as much as 5% on Friday, was up 3.52% at $17.08 per barrel and Brent was at $21.84, up 2.39% on the day.(Reporting by David Henry in New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n",
      "We get into the heart of the Q1 earnings season over the next two weeks, with almost 700 companies on deck to report results this week, including 154 S&P 500 members. This week’s docket has ample representation from all the major sectors, but the focus will be on the Technology leaders like Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and others that are coming out with results this week.All of these Tech stocks have led the market’s strong rebound from the March 23rd low, with many in the market looking at these companies as least affected, if not benefiting, from the post-outbreak locked-down operating environment. In effect, these mega cap Tech stocks appear to have become the new go-to defensive plays of the current market environment. This week’s results from these companies will likely show that investors’ confidence in these companies was largely justified.We will dig deeper into current market expectations for the Tech sector a little later, as we first want to give you a real-time update on the Q1 reporting cycle.Q1 Earnings Season Scorecard As of Friday, April 24th, we have seen Q1 results from 122 S&P 500 members or 24.4% of the index’s total membership. With another 154 index members on deck to report results this week, we will have crossed the halfway mark by the end of this week.Total earnings or aggregate net income for these 122 index members that have reported already are down -16.2% from the same period last year on +2.5% higher revenues, with 64.8% beating EPS and 63.1% beating revenue estimates.Had it not been for the Finance sector drag, Q1 earnings growth for the remaining S&P 500 companies at this stage would have been positive, thanks largely to strong results from Intel (INTC) whose Q1 earnings and revenues were up +54% and +23.5% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.Excluding the Finance sector, whose Q1 earnings for the companies that have reported already are down -48.3% on +1.7% higher revenues, earnings for the rest of S&P 500 companies that have reported would be up +8.4%.The comparison charts below put the results from these 122 index members in a historical context. The first set of two charts compare the earnings and revenue growth rates for these companies.          The second set compares the proportion of these companies beating EPS and revenue estimates.        The earnings growth comparisons start looking a lot better when seen on an ex-Finance basis, as the comparison chart below shows.        For Q1 as a whole, combining the 122 companies that have reported results already with estimates for the wide majority of still-to-come results, total earnings are expected to be down -15.3% on +1.2% higher revenues.The table below shows the summary picture for Q1, contrasted with actual results in the preceding period. We have underlined the sectors with the biggest declines in Q1.        Please note that unlike the earnings growth pace for the reported companies which looks materially different on an ex-Finance basis, the blended or combined Q1 picture doesn’t change much, as you can see above. Excluding the Finance sector, Q1 earnings for the index is on track to be down -11.4% on +1% higher revenues.Expectations for the Tech sectorIn terms of Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates, the Tech leaders reporting this week are expected to show.Apple (AAPL)– The iPhone maker’s earnings are expected to show a -20.4% decline on -7.9% lower revenues when it reports after the market’s close on Thursday, April 30th.Alphabet (GOOGL)– The search giant’s earnings are expected to drop -9.6% on +12.2% higher revenues (reports on Tuesday, April 28th after the market’s close).Amazon (AMZN)– Amazon’s earnings are expected to drop -11.7% from the year-earlier period on +23% higher revenues when it reports results after the market’s close on Thursday, April 30th.Facebook (FB)– Facebook is expected to report results after the market’s close on Wednesday, April 29th, with earnings and revenues expected to be up +102.1% and +14.7% from the year-earlier level, respectively.Microsoft (MSFT)– Microsoft is on deck to report Q1 results after the market’s close on Wednesday, April 29th, with earnings and revenues expected to increase by +9.9% and 10.7% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.All of these stocks have done better than the S&P 500 index this year, though Apple, Alphabet and Facebook are down -6.4%, -6.8% and -9.9% in the year-to-date period (the S&P 500 index is down -13.2% YTD). Amazon is up +29.4% and Microsoft is +8.7% in the same time period.For Tech sector as a whole, Q1 earnings are expected to be down -0.7% on +4.6% higher revenues. The chart below shows the sector’s Q1 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the following three periods.        This is a far better growth picture than these growth percentages would suggest, particularly when viewed in the context of what’s happening in other sectors.To get a sense of that context, take another look at the Q1 earnings growth column on the summary table you saw a little earlier. What you see in that table is that 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to suffer double-digit earnings declines in Q1. The Finance sector, the second biggest earnings contributor in the S&P 500 index is expected to suffer a -28.4% decline in earnings in Q1.In fact, it is reasonable to expect that the Tech sector’s Q1 earnings growth pace will most likely be positive, if Apple or Google has better than expected numbers this week.Earnings Estimates Are Still Falling With most economic activity at a standstill and millions of Americans losing jobs, the economic growth backdrop in the current period (2020 Q2) is very bad. We are seeing this in earnings estimates, which are falling sharply. To get a sense of this evolving earnings picture, take a look below at how earnings estimates for the June quarter have evolved over the last couple of months.        As you can see above, the negative revisions trend has accelerated in recent days, a trend that we expect to see continue as more companies report Q1 results and discuss trends in their businesses. We are seeing something similar at play in estimates for full-year 2020 as well, as the chart below shows.        The chart below puts full-year 2020 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent years and what is expected beyond this year.        As you can see here, current estimates reflect a strong rebound in growth next year and beyond. But it is hard to have a lot of confidence in these expectations as long as the public health issue remains unsettled.For an in-depth look at the overall earnings picture and expectations for Q1, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Making Sense of the Earnings Picture During the CoronavirusLooking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

The two tech titans are on tap to report their March-quarter results next week, giving investors a glimpse at how the pandemic has affected their global businesses.Boeing Co tumbled more than 6% after a report the planemaker was planning to cut 787 Dreamliner output by about half.All of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes moved up, with information technology jumping 2.1% and materials rallying 1.5%.Even with Friday's gains, the S&P 500 ended the week lower, with investors fearful of a deep economic slump following a near-crash in April business activity and weekly jobless claims topping 26 million in five weeks.The index has recovered more than 25% from its March low and expectations are growing that more businesses will be allowed to reopen as coronavirus infections showed signs of peaking.Georgia became the first state to push ahead with its plan to allow an array of small businesses to reopen on Friday despite disapproval from President Donald Trump and health experts.Investors may be overestimating how quickly U.S. businesses can go back to normal, and the S&P 500 could fall 5% or more as it becomes evident that resuming normal economic activity may not happen for months, warned Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in North Carolina.\"We think this is likely to be a little bit of a sideways market, and we won't be surprised to see a bit of downside before we see more upside,\" Freedman said.Overall, analysts still expect a 15% decline in S&P 500 first-quarter earnings, with profits for the energy sector estimated to slump more than 60%, raising fears of debt defaults, layoffs and possible bankruptcies.New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly rose in March, but the gains are not likely to be sustainable amid the pandemic, which has abruptly shut down the economy and contributed to a collapse in crude oil prices.The CBOE volatility index, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, was down for the third straight session.Amazon rose 0.4% to a record high close ahead of its quarterly report on Thursday. With online shopping booming as people avoid traditional stores, Amazon's stock market value has ballooned by over $100 billion since Feb. 19, just before coronavirus fears gripped Wall Street.The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.11% to end at 23,775.27 points, while the S&P 500 gained 1.39% to 2,836.74.The Nasdaq Composite added 1.65% to 8,634.52.For the week, the S&P 500 fell 1.3%, the Dow lost 1.9% and the Nasdaq lost 0.2%.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.65-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.00-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 35 new highs and 14 new lows.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.2 billion shares, compared with a 12.5 billion-share average over the last 20 trading days.

      "(Bloomberg) --Apple Inc. and Google said they are putting stronger privacy protections in their upcoming contact-tracing tool for Covid-19 and that an early version will launch for developers next week.The companies said the system’s tracking keys -- a string of characters linked to a user’s device -- will be generated in more random ways, and that Bluetooth data will now be encrypted, making it more difficult for individuals to be identified by hackers. Apps using the tool will also now limit the recording of the time people are exposed to an infected person to a maximum of 30 minutes.The companies said they made these changes after discussions with governments and public health app developers. The technology has been criticized for potentially sharing too much private health information, while France has asked Apple to relax some privacy protections.Read more: France Says Apple Bluetooth Policy Is Blocking Virus TrackerThe system, unveiled two weeks ago, will add technology to the iOS and Android operating systems that alerts users if they have come into contact with a person with Covid-19. The companies are now calling the technology Exposure Notification, a term they said more accurately describes the functionality.The first phase -- tools for public health apps to add contact tracing -- will launch publicly in mid-May after an early beta version of the software is released to developers next week. In the coming months, the technology will be embedded more deeply into the Apple and Google operating systems to be less reliant on apps.Read more: Apple, Google Covid-19 Contact Tracing to Require VerificationThe companies also explained that if a person inputs that they have tested positive for Covid-19 into the system, they will be added to a positive diagnosis list so the system can notify other people they have come into contact with. They reiterated that the system doesn’t reveal a user’s identity or location to Apple or Google.In a Frequently Asked Questions page, the companies said public health authority apps “will be able to access a list of beacons provided by users confirmed as positive for COVID-19 who have opted in to sharing them.”A beacon is a wireless signal that can be broadcast and picked up by smartphones. At least once a day, Apple and Google’s system will download a list of beacons belonging to people who tested positive and shared that with their public health authority. Each device will check the list of beacons it has recorded against the list downloaded from a server maintained by the companies. If there’s a match between the beacons stored on the device and the positive diagnosis list, the user may be notified and advised on next steps.This approach, which requires the second phase of the project to work, means smartphone owners can be alerted without telling health authorities that specific people have come into contact with infected individuals.The companies are also adding new features for public health developers to build contact-tracing apps. The system will give apps data on the strength of Bluetooth signals so the distance between devices can be more accurately estimated. Developers will also be able to specify distance and time to determine what constitutes Covid-19 exposure for their apps. The tool will also determine how many days since a person has been exposed.Apple said that the software update to enable the system will work on devices released in the last four years. Google said the tool will work with Android 6.0 or higher, which covers about 2 billion gadgets.(Updates with more details on technology in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",

In addition, Bluetooth data will now be encrypted to make it more difficult for specific users to be identified by hackers. The companies also said that apps using the tool will now limit the recording of the time people are exposed to an infected person to a maximum of 30 minutes.The tracking system does not use GPS location data and stores the most sensitive data in a decentralized way on users' phones, but it has been criticized for potentially sharing too much private health data. Health and privacy researchers also cited privacy concerns that the companies addressed on Friday by making it harder to use system-generated data to track people.The two companies announced earlier this month that they were collaborating on the mobile software that would help track the spread of the coronavirus. The opt-in tool would be embedded in Android and iOS operating systems, and is designed for \"contact tracing,\" or tracking how the virus spreads from person to person. The tool would tell people if they have been in contact with someone who was infected with the virus, and also allow users to report to a public health agency if they have been infected. Shares of Apple were up 2% to $280.54 on Friday, while those of Alphabet were off 1.1% to $1,257.37.The first phase of the system consists of tools for public health apps to add contact tracing, and will launch publicly in mid-May after an early beta version of the software is released to developers next week. In the coming months, the technology will be embedded more deeply into the Apple and Google operating systems and become less reliant on apps.Apple and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer’s Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

Brands (YUM) Earnings Spotlight: Amazon.com (AMZN, $2,399.45) - Amazon.com's quarterly report, due out after the April 30 close, is one of the most anticipated of the first-quarter earnings season. The e-commerce company has been touted as a prime example of a \"social distancing\" stock - not just because its delivery service has become essential amid the lockdown, but also because of its streaming content, as well as its cloud services that businesses simply can't suddenly pull the plug on. As a result, AMZN stock has climbed 10.5% since the Feb. 19 bull-market peak, versus a 17% decline in the S&P 500. Wall Street's analyst community has gone gonzo over the stock, too, issuing a wild 43 Buy ratings on AMZN over the past three months versus just one Hold and no Sells. MKM Partners' Rohit Kulkarni is among the most recent Buy calls, raising his price target from $2,325 per share to $2,500 thanks to the company's diversification across third-party sales, Amazon Web Services, advertising and Whole Foods. He does warn, however, that short-term, analysts might be too optimistic about its Q1 results. On the whole, Wall Street is looking for a 22.2% bump to revenues to $72.95 billion, but a 10.6% decline in profits to $6.34 per share.Earnings Spotlight: Apple (AAPL, $275.03) - The numbers for Apple's fiscal second quarter, to be reported after the April 30 closing bell, don't look cataclysmic. Analysts are expecting a 5.8% decline in revenues to $54.79 billion and a 7.3% drop in profits to $2.28 per share. Wall Street is looking for single-digit year-over-year declines for its current quarter, too. Moreover, the pros have mostly stayed by Apple's side as the stock has roughly tracked the market, offering up 27 Buys over the past quarter. But not everyone is sold. Six analysts have called the stock a Hold, and two - including Goldman Sachs - say to Sell the iPhone maker. On April 17, Goldman downgraded the stock to $233 per share, implying a 15% decline from current prices, over expectations of a 36% decline in iPhone sales in its fiscal Q2, and depressed selling prices through 2021. Apple has already taken a step to juice device sales amid a potential downturn, releasing a $399 iPhone SE that easily becomes the current lineup's cheapest option. A few bullish analysts also believe that Apple will outline an increased stock buyback authorization and raise its dividend by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage.Other Noteworthy Reports: 1-800-FLOWERS (FLWS), Altria (MO), American Airlines (AAL), Church & Dwight (CHD), Cigna (CI), Comcast (CMCSA), ConocoPhillips (COP), CoreSite Realty (COR), Dow (DOW), Dunkin' (DNKN), Exelon (EXC), Expedia (EXPE), First Solar (FSLR), Franklin Resources (BEN), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Goodyear Tire (GT), Hanesbrands (HBI), Iron Mountain (IRM), Kellogg (K), Kraft Heinz (KHC), McDonald's (MCD), MGM Resorts (MGM), Molson Coors (TAP), Monster Beverage (MNST), Planet Fitness (PLNT), Public Storage (PSA), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A), Simon Properties (SPG), Six Flags (SIX), Southern (SO), Stanley Black & Decker (SWK), Twitter (TWTR), Visa (V), Welltower (WELL), Western Digital (WDC), Whirlpool (WHR) Earnings Spotlight: Chevron (CVX, $86.80) - Investors looking for a clearer picture of how the energy sector's largest names are faring against extremely depressed oil prices will get their chance before the May 1 open, when Chevron and rival Exxon Mobil (XOM) will report their first-quarter earnings. CVX has already telegraphed some of the pain: Chevron previously has said that it will suspend stock buybacks and cut its 2020 capital expenditures by $4 billion ... though its CEO called the dividend the company's \"No. 1 priority,\" which has most investors expecting the company will remain among the ranks of the Dividend Aristocrats. Still, oil's crushing crash amid both coronavirus-suppressed demand and Saudi Arabia's brief price war with Russia should result in an ugly set of Q1 numbers. The pros are looking for a 14.1% decline in revenues to $30.23 billion, with profits plunging 54.4% to 67 cents per share.Earnings Spotlight: Clorox (CLX, $189.92) - Also reporting Friday is a popular \"recession-proof\" pick, Clorox, which doles out consumer staples products including its namesake cleaning solutions, as well as Tilex and S.O.S. cleaners, Glad trash bags, Fresh Step cat litter, Brita water filters and Kingsford charcoal. Clorox has delivered a 15% gain since Feb. 19 - little surprise to anyone who has gone to a grocery store that's out of Clorox bleach and wipes. Analysts think Clorox's results, due out May 1 ahead of the open, will be simply gorgeous: They're projecting a 10.3% revenue increase to $1.71 billion, and a 16% pop in profits to $1.67 per share. Those aren't your typical consumer staples results. The pros, however, are skeptical about the company's returns from here. The company has racked up more Holds (seven) and Sells (three) than Buys (two) over the past three months, including two Sell calls over the past two weeks. The primary concern appears to be valuation, with Clorox trading near all-time highs and at valuation multiples much richer than the market.Other Noteworthy Reports: AbbVie (ABBV), Apollo Global Management (APO), Colgate-Palmolive (CL), DISH Network (DISH), Estee Lauder (EL), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Honeywell (HON), Phillips 66 (PSX), Ventas (VTR), W.P.

      "By Stephen Nellis(Reuters) - Apple Inc <AAPL.O> and Alphabet Inc's <GOOGL.O> Google on Friday updated technical details of the coronavirus contact tracing system they plan to release next month, saying new features would strengthen privacy protections and give health authorities more detailed data.The system announced on April 10 will use Bluetooth technology to let authorities build apps to alert people who have been in proximity with those who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus.The technology does not employ GPS location data and stores most sensitive data in a decentralized way on users' phones. The approach opened a rift with European governments planning systems that would store data on centralized servers.Without the Apple-Google technology, apps built by those governments will face limitations such as needing a phone's screen to be unlocked to work properly.Health and privacy researchers also cited privacy concerns that the companies addressed on Friday by making it harder to use system-generated data to track people.The numbers that identify users will be randomly generated, and so-called \"metadata\" such as Bluetooth signal strength and users' phone models will now be encrypted along with primary data about who they have been near.\"Exposure time,\" or how long two phones have been near each other, will be rounded to 5-minute intervals, to prevent using detailed time data to match up phones to people.The companies also sought to address health researchers' concerns that the system would be ineffective. Since Bluetooth signals can penetrate some walls and can be detected even when brief and faint, researchers worried about false alerts from neighbors in apartment buildings or passers-by in public spaces.Apple and Google will now provide data about Bluetooth power levels to better estimate how close two phones came to each other and for how long, letting authorities set their own thresholds for when to alert people.The companies also said they would provide data on how many days had passed since the last contact with an infected person, to help authorities notify users about what steps to take.(Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Richard Chang)\n",

The company’s core wireless business is somewhat insulated from economic pain and has showed signs of benefiting from widespread stay-at-home orders and the shift toward remote work. But the company’s media and satellite-TV divisions are facing heightened challenges in a weak economic environment. Meanwhile, significant demands on the company’s cash flows remain: AT&T has dividend and debt paydown commitments to meet while investing in upgrading its network to 5G, deploying fiber, and creating original content for HBO Max, which will launch at the end of May.In his 13 years as CEO of AT&T, Stephenson, 60, oversaw several major deals that reshaped the century-old telecommunications company and impacted the structure of the U.S. wireless industry.

AT&T’s breakup fee to T-Mobile came to billions of dollars in cash and wireless spectrum licenses that gave the then-struggling carrier the resources to take market share and eventually buy Sprint.More recently, Stephenson has moved AT&T away from its phone-business roots to become a diversified media and telecom giant. The transformation, though, came at considerable cost and resulted in significant debt. A $67 billion acquisition of DirecTV closed in 2015, and the $109 billion purchase of Time Warner was completed last year. In the process, AT&T became the most indebted company in the U.S., and took on a much more cyclical profile than its pure-play wireless peers. That could come back to hurt the company this year, as a coronavirus-induced recession causes advertisers to pull back on spending and consumers to accelerate their cord-cutting at DirecTV. AT&T’s first-quarter earnings reported Wednesday were a preview of what’s to come later this year.AT&T stock has returned 53% including dividends since Stephenson was appointed CEO and chairman on May 9, 2007. That compares with 143% for the S&P 500, 182% for Verizon, and 118% for T-Mobile. Apple replaced AT&T as a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2015, nearly a century after Ma Bell joined the index.Stankey, 57, became president and COO of AT&T in October 2019, when AT&T Communications chief John Donovan—who was seen as a CEO in waiting—left the company. Stankey has worn numerous hats at AT&T, including chief technology officer, CEO of AT&T Operations, and CEO of WarnerMedia, since he joined a predecessor business in 1985. “I’m honored to be elected the next CEO of AT&T, a company with a rich history and a bright future,” Stankey said in a statement. “My thanks go to Randall for his vision and outstanding leadership during a period of tremendous change and investment in the core capabilities needed to position AT&T well for the years ahead.”“With the recent hiring of Jason Kilar to be CEO of WarnerMedia, we believe the table was now set for this transition,” Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche wrote on Friday. “Stankey has seen and served AT&T from all sides given his many prior roles at the company. We believe he brings the necessary skill-set to the company through the next chapter of its evolution. He is a known quantity to the Street.”Stephenson’s dealmaking has faced criticism in recent years. Activist hedge fund Elliott Management disclosed a large stake in AT&T last fall and advocated for changes to the company’s board. The firm argued that AT&T stock’s underperformance stemmed from misguided acquisitions along with weaker-than-expected results at the company’s core businesses. In response to Elliott’s proposals, AT&T unveiled a three-year plan that included new targets for earnings, shareholder returns, cost reduction, and profit margins. In its earnings release on Wednesday, AT&T withdrew those targets citing the coronavirus’ impact on the economy.Elliott, led by Paul Singer, said Friday that it supports Stankey as AT&T’s next CEO.“We have been engaged with the company throughout the search process, which was a robust one, including a range of highly qualified outside candidates and overseen by independent directors,” Elliott partner Jesse Cohn said in a statement. “We look forward to working with John as he begins his term as CEO.” Write to Nicholas Jasinski at nicholas.jasinski@barrons.com AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson is stepping down, effective July 1.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

      "* Smartphone technology repurposed for pandemic control* France, Germany want support for their 'centralized' apps* Apple and Google decline on privacy grounds* Silicon Valley supports approach taken by Swiss and othersBy Mathieu Rosemain and Douglas BusvinePARIS/BERLIN, April 24 (Reuters) - A standoff between the two largest nations in the European Union and Silicon Valley escalated on Friday as Apple and Google rebuffed demands by France and Germany to back their approach to using smartphone technology to trace coronavirus infections.Countries are rushing to develop apps to assess the risk that one person can infect another with the coronavirus, helping to isolate those who could spread the COVID-19 disease.In Europe, most countries have chosen short-range Bluetooth 'handshakes' between devices as the best approach, dismissing the alternative of using location data pursued by some countries in Asia as intrusive.But a rift has opened up between countries led by France and Germany that want to hold personal data on a central server, and others that back a decentralized approach in which Bluetooth logs are stored on individual devices.Apple and Alphabet's Google, whose operating systems run 99% of smartphones, have promised tweaks in May that would accommodate the decentralized approach. A trial version is due out next week.That has added a political dimension to the standards-setting debate, with a senior French official saying it was time for Europe to stop caving in to pressure from the United States.\"The European states are being completely held hostage by Google and Apple,\" said the official, who is involved in coordinating efforts to develop a French contact-tracing app called StopCovid.BACKGROUND CHECKAlthough Bluetooth-based smartphone contact tracing is an untested technology and early results in countries like Singapore are modest, its development is already redefining the relationship between the state and individual.Reversing a debate that normally pits privacy-conscious Europeans against a data-hungry U.S.-tech industry, it is Apple that has refused to allow Bluetooth monitoring of other devices to run in the background on its iPhones. Such monitoring would open the way to greater state surveillance, say privacy experts.That creates a problem for France and Germany as now, for their apps to work, a phone would need to be unlocked and have Bluetooth running in the foreground - a drain on the battery and an inconvenience for the user.Germany also called on Apple to support the app being developed by research group Fraunhofer HHI for the Robert Koch Institute, the federal agency that is coordinating the national health policy response to coronavirus.\"The federal government has great trust in the system that is being tested by Fraunhofer,\" government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer told a news conference. \"With a decentralized system, you have to trust Apple and Google.\"PRIVACY FIRSTSenior executives from Apple and Google said on Friday that they had jointly designed tools with the express goal of supporting decentralized contact-tracing apps they say provide the best privacy protection to users.\"Those privacy principles are not going to change,\" Gary Davis, Apple's global director of privacy and law enforcement requests, told a webinar hosted by the liberal Renew faction in the European Parliament.\"They are fundamental minimum privacy principles that are needed to make this work.\"Dave Burke, vice president for engineering at Google, endorsed the decentralized DP-3T protocol developed by a Swiss-led team of researchers, calling it \"the best privacy-preserving solution\".It was preferable, Burke said, to support a single standard to ensure that national contact tracing apps can talk to each other across borders.\"Trying to support more than one approach is going to add to the fragmentation, cause cross-border problems and really defeat the whole purpose,\" he said.Switzerland plans to launch a Bluetooth app on May 11 based on DP-3T, which stands for Decentralised Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing. It was joined on Friday by Estonia, which also plans an app based on the DP-3T standard.Austria's Red Cross, whose Stopp Corona contact tracing app was the first to go live in Europe last month and has been downloaded 400,000 times, said this week it would upgrade its architecture and was leaning towards adopting DP-3T.

The San Jose, California-based firm breaks its revenue streams down into three general categories: Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud.ADBE topped our Q1 fiscal 2020 earnings estimate in mid-March and posted record quarterly revenue of $3.09 billion, up 19%. Looking ahead, our Zacks estimates call for ADBE’s fiscal 2020 sales to jump 16.3%, with FY21 projected to climb another 15% higher. These would come on top of the cloud software firm’s roughly 24% revenue growth in the trailing three years.Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to pop 24.4% and 13.5%, respectively over the next two fiscal years. Adobe’s bottom-line growth outlook is a great sign at a time when many firms are expected to see their EPS shrink. Adobe currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), alongside “B” grades for Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.ABDE stock is up around 3% in 2020 to crush the S&P 500’s 13% decline and has climbed 24% in the last 12 months. Yet the stock still rests 12% below its 52-week highs, which could give it more room to run.The stock is also trading at its three-year median in terms of forward-12 month earnings. Adobe’s balance is also solid and it is part of an industry that rests in the top 19% of our more than 250 Zacks industries right now.NvidiaNvidia is a GPU powerhouse that is poised to benefit from the continued growth of high-end video gaming, data centers, artificial intelligence, and more. NVDA beat our Q4 fiscal 2020 earnings and revenue estimates in February, and on March 24 updated investors on its outlook via a virtual meeting with analysts.The chip maker said that overall demand remains strong from “hyperscale” cloud service providers that use Nvidia’s chips in their data centers, despite pandemic concerns. The firm also seemed pleased with its video game-focused space as millions of people are mostly confined to their homes.Nvidia has been rewarded for its strength within the vital semiconductor industry, with its stock price up 52% in the last year and 24% in 2020, which crushes its industry’s 3% pop. Despite its strong price performance, NVDA stock hovers around 9% below its 52-week highs.Investors should also note that Nvidia on April 16 announced that it received “approval from all necessary authorities” to complete its $6.9 billion acquisition of “high-performance interconnect technology” firm Mellanox. And Nvidia’s balance sheet can support what will be its biggest acquisition ever. NVDA ended fiscal 2020 with $10.89 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, against just $1.78 billion in total current liabilities and $1.99 billion in long-term debt.         Looking ahead, NVDA, which is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports “A” grade for Growth and Momentum, is projected to see its fiscal 2021 revenue jump 19.4%, with FY22 set to pop another 16% to hit $15.09 billion. At the bottom end of the income statement, NVDA’s adjusted earnings are expected to surge 31.4% and 20%, respectively over this same stretch. Along with this growth outlook, Nvidia also pays a dividend. SalesforceSalesforce is one of the world’s largest enterprise-application-software companies by revenue. The firm’s cloud-based customer relationship management services offer customers a wide range of tools and applications to help run everything from sales and e-commerce to marketing and analytics. The San Francisco-based tech giant boasts over 150,000 customers and it has bolstered its offerings through AI and voice-controls.Salesforce last summer completed its largest ever deal to buy Tableau to help grow its data analytics software business. The company topped our Q4 estimates in late February, with Q4 revenue up 35% to $4.85 billion. In Q3, CEO Marc Benioff said that CRM was “now on track to double our revenue in five years.”Salesforce’s full-year revenue is projected to jump 21.8% and 18.5%, respectively in FY21 and FY22. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are expected to pop 4% and 22% over this stretch. CRM is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), like its peers on the list, that also rocks a “B” grade for Growth and an “A” for Momentum.CRM looks set to expand for years to come as businesses big and small transform for the digital age. And longer-term investors can currently scoop up Salesforce stock roughly 23% below its 52-week highs.Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity.

      "For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – April 24, 2020 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Netflix, Inc. NFLX, Apple Inc. AAPL, Facebook, Inc. FB, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog: Will FAANG Stocks Steal the Show This Earnings Season, As Well?As Wall Street’s tech behemoths gear up to post first-quarter earnings results, all eyes are particularly on the FAANG group (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet-owned Google). FAANG’s stellar market value determines the movement of the stock market, and thus any upsetting outcome will have far-reaching consequences.But despite an anticipated ugly earnings season, the FAANG group has got off to a flying start. Netflix, Inc.’s blowout results, with doubling of the subscriber base, have been cheered by investors. Widespread lockdowns in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak have compelled people to find ways of entertainment at home. Netflix reported 15.77 million new subscribers globally in the first quarter, way higher than its projected 7 million. The company’s executives confirmed in a letter to shareholders that “during the first two months of the Q1, our membership growth was similar to the prior two years, including in [the U.S. and Canada], and then with lockdown orders in many countries starting in March, many more households joined Netflix to enjoy entertainment.”Netflix’s earnings per share came in at $1.57, soaring from76 cents a share a year ago. Revenues rose to$5.77 billion from $4.52 billion in a year ago. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 45.8% against the Broadcast Radio and Television industry’s estimated decline of 2.1%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let us, thus, focus on the upcoming earnings reports of the remaining FAANG stocks. iPhone maker Apple Inc. is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2020 earnings on Apr 30, after market close. The coronavirus pandemic forced Apple to shut down its own as well as partners’ stores, which has certainly impacted revenues. Apple’s supply also got disrupted due to slower-than-expected return to work in China after an extended New Year holiday aimed at curtailing the spread of the deadly virus. What’s more, the virus spread in the United States toward the end of March, which has most likely hurt sales.Thus, analysts expect Apples revenues to decline year over year. But the company’s progress with5G, content, software services, wellness and augmented reality might have boosted earnings. In fact, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has an Earnings ESP of +0.51%. This is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to positively surprise with their upcoming earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Before Apple, Facebook, Inc. will be reporting first-quarter results on Apr 29, after market close. The social media giant’s revenues increased 25% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2019. However, management said that it expects year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter to “decelerate by a low to mid single-digit percentage point as compared to Q4 growth rate.” Now, that’s before the pandemic had hit global markets. Not surprisingly, analysts now expect a much slower revenue growth than management’s predictions. By the way, advertising revenues account for almost all of Facebook’s revenues. Lest we forget, the company’s ad auction prices tanked 20% in both February and March. To make matters worse, ad agencies noted steep decline in conversion rates, which measure what steps people are taking after clicking on an ad. This might dent the Zacks Rank #3 company’s first quarter profit margins. Coming to e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc., there is no doubt that it is making the most of the shift in consumer preference caused by the pandemic. With many stores closed across the United States and Americans not willing to venture out, Amazon’s sales have skyrocketed.The current work-from-home scenario has increased the need for cloud storage, something that bodes well for Amazon Web Services. Thus, the Zacks Rank #2 company’s cloud sales are likely to have risen in the quarter to be reported. In fact, Amazon expects overall revenues at $73.3 billion for the quarter ended March 2020, suggesting an increase of22.8% from the year-ago period. Profits of $6.35 per share are anticipated for the first quarter, indicating as light drop from $7.09 reported a year ago.Last but actually next up, Alphabet Inc. is scheduled to report earnings for the quarter ended March 2020 on Apr 28, after market close. And we certainly expect mixed results! Alphabet’s strengthening cloud unit has been aiding substantial revenue growth. Thus, the company’s revenues for the first three months of this year are expected at $33.3 billion, suggesting an improvement from year-ago sales of $29.48 billion. However, the Zacks Rank #3 company may face a drop in profits as it had banned advertisements related to sensitive issues like coronavirus during the first quarter. The Google-parent company’s expected earnings per share for the first quarter is $11.16, calling for a decline from $11.90 reported during the same period last year.Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it’s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity.A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech.

      "Facebook FB is set to report first-quarter 2020 results on Apr 29.The company expects the first-quarter revenue growth rate to decline in low-to-mid-single-digit percentage on a sequential basis due to ad targeting-related headwinds and the increasing impact from global privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.Moreover, changes made by Apple AAPL and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google in their mobile operating systems and browser platforms limited Facebook’s ability to track the user activity trend.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $17.29 billion, indicating an increase of 14.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Additionally, the consensus mark for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.72 per share, having been revised 10% downward in the past 30 days but indicating a whopping 102.4% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.Notably, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while beating the same in the other two, the average negative surprise being 22.1%. Facebook, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseFacebook, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Facebook, Inc. Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.Coronavirus to Hurt Ad SalesFacebook witnessed a significant jump in the usage of its services including Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp in the first quarter amid the growing incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.Total messaging surged more than 50% in countries most affected by the coronavirus in the past month. The company also witnessed increased traffic in its feed and stories products. Further, voice and video calling more than doubled on Messenger and WhatsApp in places bearing the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter MAUs and DAUs worldwide is pegged at 2.544 billion and 1.678 billion, respectively.Nevertheless, Facebook expects its ad sales for the to-be-reported quarter to take a hit from lockdown and mass quarantine measures undertaken in a number of countries to break the chain.Facebook’s ad-sales warning followed Twitter’s TWTR withdrawal of its first-quarter 2020 guidance due to the pervasive impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) anxiety on advertiser demand.However, Facebook’s solid user base in the Asia Pacific, growth in Instagram Stories and Feed, and concerted efforts to improve privacy, transparency and authenticity of its platform are expected to reflect on the top line.The consensus mark for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s first-quarter advertising revenues is pegged at $17.52 billion. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key Initiatives to Fight CoronavirusFacebook announced a $100-million investment to support journalism, especially the hard-hit local news agencies by ad revenue loss due to the coronavirus pandemic. The company is investing $25 million in grants for local news organizations via the Facebook Journalism Project. Moreover, it is offering $75 million in marketing spend. Thus, money is moving to news organizations across the globe.Further, during the quarter, Facebook took several initiatives to fight the coronavirus pandemic. It announced the launch of a $100-million program consisting of cash grants and ad credits in a bid to bail out small businesses.Additionally, the company supported fact-checking operations with AFP and other media companies including Reuters and the Associated Press, under which false content is downgraded in news feeds so that fewer people see it.Other Q1 DevelopmentsFacebook also inked a deal with British device manufacturer Plessey Semiconductors Ltd. Per the pact, Plessey’s LED manufacturing operations will be dedicated to aid Facebook prototype and develop new technologies for potential use in the AR/VR space for the next several years.Notably, Plessey specializes in manufacturing microLED displays for AR headsets and heads-up-displays.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

      "Apple AAPL is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2020 results on Apr 30.Markedly, on Feb 17, Apple announced that it anticipates missing the revenue guidance for the fiscal second quarter due to iPhone supply constraints and lower demand in China, both on account of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in the country. For the quarter to be reported, the company had expected revenues between $63 billion and $67 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $53.44 billion, indicating a decline of 7.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Moreover, the consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.10 per share, having declined 7.9% over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a 14.6% decline from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.Notably, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 6.1%. Apple Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote iPhone Sales Likely to DeclineApple’s fortunes are heavily reliant on iPhone, which is by far, its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 60.9% of net sales in the last reported quarter wherein sales grew 7.6% year over year to $55.96 billion.However, Apple’s second-quarter iPhone unit sales are expected to have been muted due to the coronavirus outbreak in China that significantly disrupted the supply chain. Moreover, while factories in China resumed operations, Apple has been facing a bleak demand scenario as the nations around the world enforce social-distancing measures.China is the only major market where Apple’s stores reopened. The company operates approximately 500 stores worldwide, of which 270 are located in the United States. It shuttered 458 stores outside Greater China on Mar 13 to decelerate the spread of the coronavirus.Notably, in January, iPhone sales in China dropped 28% month over month. Further, the company sold only 494,000 iPhones in the region during February, reflecting a 61% drop from 1.3 million in the year-ago period. However, sales jumped sharply in March with Apple selling 2.5 million iPhones.Nevertheless, Apple’s market share in China, marking its third largest market with roughly 15% contribution to its sales, shrank over the past several years as local Android brands steadily launched higher-end phones.The iPhone-maker endures intensified competition from rivals presently releasing 5G devices compatible with China’s enhanced telecommunications networks while Apple is yet to launch an iPhone with 5G capability.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for iPhone sales currently stands at $25.95 billion, indicating a 16.4% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Apple Music & App Store to Aid ServicesThe Services segment became the new cash cow for Apple, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding subscriber base of Apple Music, Apple Podcasts and Arcade gaming are likely to have benefited the top line in second-quarter fiscal 2020. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Apple currently has more than 480 million paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. App Store continues to grab attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company offer exciting new apps that drive traffic.Additionally, Apple’s endeavor to broaden its ecosystem through partnerships with Amazon AMZN is a positive for the Services segment. Further, Apple Music’s availability on Amazon Echo devices and Fire TV is helping it expand its footprint and compete better with Spotify SPOT and Alphabet’s GOOGL YouTube Music.Although Sweden-based Spotify is leading the space at the moment, Apple Music is catching up fast. The service now caters to more than 60 million subscribers, trailing Spotify’s 124-million premium subscriber count.Moreover, Apple Podcasts beams more than one million shows in above 100 languages. The iCloud service is free but allows users to upgrade for extra storage. Additionally, the Arcade gaming service includes ad-free original titles designed for Apple devices and it offers unlimited access to the entire catalogue of more than 100 exclusive games, all playable across iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac and Apple TV.Although supply-chain disruption due to the coronavirus outbreak is expected to dash iPhone’s hopes for decent quarterly results, strong Services business bodes well for Apple’s prospects.The consensus mark for Services currently stands at $12.90 billion, indicating 12.6% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.
